EXPLORATION OF ALGORITHMIC TRADING STRATEGIES FOR

1.
This snippet is an abstract from a research paper that explores algorithmic trading strategies for the Bitcoin market. The researchers use machine learning models to predict the direction of Bitcoin's price movement on a daily basis. They incorporate both internal features of the Bitcoin network and external features, such as stock market data and social media data, to inform their predictions. The researchers evaluate their models using real-world trading data and find that their models are profitable, outperforming a traditional buy-and-hold strategy when incorporating a risk tolerance score. The paper highlights the potential of machine learning models in extracting profit from the Bitcoin market and suggests further research in this area.

In simpler terms, the researchers are using computer programs to predict whether the price of Bitcoin will go up or down each day. They use different types of information, like data from the Bitcoin network and other sources, to make these predictions. They test their predictions using real trading data and find that their models can make money. This research shows that using machine learning can be a successful strategy for trading Bitcoin.

This snippet discusses the challenges of reproducing the results from a previous research paper by Mudassir et al. [2020]. The researchers of this current paper attempted to replicate the models and results reported in the previous study but encountered issues with overfitting, which means that the models were too closely fitted to the training data and performed poorly on new, unseen data. They found discrepancies in the reported results, including models being trained on the test data and errors in applying the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) step.

The researchers then describe their own approach to the Bitcoin price prediction problem. They developed an algorithmic trading method using a wide range of features that were not fully explored in previous studies. They also utilized the probabilistic outputs of the classifiers to parameterize trading risk, allowing traders to specify their risk appetite.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 investigates the reproducibility challenges of the previous study, Section 3 describes the approach taken by the researchers in this current study, Section 4 presents the results of their machine learning models, and Section 5 concludes the research.

In simpler terms, the researchers tried to reproduce the results of a previous study but found issues with overfitting and errors in the reported results. They then developed their own approach to predict Bitcoin prices using a variety of features and taking into account trading risk.

This snippet discusses the methodologies used in the research paper. It highlights the challenges of rigorous and robust model development and emphasizes the importance of transparency and openness in the data science field.

The proposed methodology starts with the construction of a dataset using both internal features from the Bitcoin Blockchain network and external factors that may affect the Bitcoin price. The data collection process involves scraping data from various sources, such as bitinfocharts.com and data.bitcoinity.org, to gather internal Bitcoin features and additional features from different Bitcoin exchanges.

In addition to the internal features, the researchers incorporate external features, such as stock and commodity indices, macroeconomic data, sentiment-based features, and currency exchange data. They significantly expand the standard feature set used in previous studies to explore untapped feature areas and increase prediction power. The external features are scraped from finance.yahoo.com using the Yahoo Finance API.

The overall methodology includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training with hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation, and evaluation using real-world data.

In simpler terms, the researchers collect a wide range of data related to Bitcoin and external factors that may influence its price. They preprocess the data, select relevant features, train machine learning models, and evaluate the models using real-world data.

Potential use cases of the code and methodologies presented in this paper include developing algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, conducting research on the impact of different features on cryptocurrency prices, and exploring the use of machine learning models for predicting financial markets.

This snippet discusses the data collection and pre-processing steps in the research paper. It highlights the importance of incorporating a diverse set of features, including commodity futures, stock indices, currency exchange rates, economic indicators, and social media sentiment.

The researchers collected internal Bitcoin features from sources like bitinfocharts.com and data.bitcoinity.org, which provide technical indicators and data from various Bitcoin exchanges. They also collected external features from sources like finance.yahoo.com, which include commodity futures, stock indices, and currency exchange rates.

To preprocess the data, missing values are filled using techniques like linear interpolation for internal Bitcoin data and forward filling for commodity, stock, and currency exchange data. The researchers handle the sequential nature of the data and the growth of Bitcoin over time by avoiding the use of the most common value for filling missing values.

The data collection and pre-processing steps aim to create a comprehensive dataset with a wide range of features, covering internal Bitcoin data, external factors, economic indicators, and social media sentiment.

In simpler terms, the researchers collected data from various sources, including Bitcoin-related websites, financial platforms, and social media. They selected a diverse set of features, such as Bitcoin network data, commodity prices, stock market indices, currency exchange rates, economic indicators, and social media sentiment. They then processed the data by filling missing values and ensuring the sequential nature of the data is preserved.

Potential use cases of the code and methodologies presented in this paper include developing predictive models for cryptocurrency prices, conducting research on the impact of different factors on cryptocurrency markets, and exploring the use of social media sentiment in financial analysis.

This snippet discusses the feature engineering, feature selection, prediction models, and trading strategy used in the research paper.

In the feature engineering step, the researchers create additional features, such as lag features that represent the difference in price between the current day and the previous day. They also use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, which helps capture the variance in the data using a smaller set of features.

The researchers select a date range for the training data, maximizing the interval size while avoiding missing values. The training data spans from August 2015 to December 2020, with a separate quarter from January 2021 to April 2021 reserved for testing on unseen real-world data.

For the prediction models, the researchers explore simpler models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB). They use nested time-series cross-validation during hyperparameter optimization to ensure the models are not overfitting. The chosen hyperparameters are then used to train the final prediction models on the full dataset.

In the trading strategy, the models are used to make daily price direction classifications. If a model predicts a price increase, one Bitcoin is bought, and if a price decrease is predicted, one Bitcoin is sold. The position is neutralized the following day, either by selling the purchased Bitcoin or buying back the sold Bitcoin. This strategy allows the researchers to track the profit and loss of the models in real-world trading.

The results and discussion section evaluates the performance of the classification models using nested cross-validation. The metrics recorded include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The table presents the results for different datasets obtained using specific numbers of PCA components.

In simpler terms, the researchers create additional features and reduce the dimensionality of the data using PCA. They explore different prediction models and evaluate their performance using cross-validation. The models are then used to make daily trading decisions based on price direction predictions, and the profit and loss are tracked. The results are presented in a table, showing the accuracy and other metrics of the models.

Potential use cases of the code and methodologies presented in this paper include developing trading strategies for cryptocurrencies, evaluating the performance of different prediction models, and conducting research on the predictability of financial markets.

This snippet discusses the results and discussion section of the research paper. It presents the evaluation metrics, feature significance, and trading performance of the developed algorithmic trading models.

The evaluation metrics show the performance of the models using cross-validation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) models achieved the highest accuracy scores, with the SVM model achieving an accuracy of 56% and an F1 score of 0.716.

The feature significance analysis reveals that the technical indicators used in conjunction with the features in the previous study have a significant impact on the models' performance. Although the feature set in this study was expanded, only a small percentage of the top 200 most important features were added.

The trading performance analysis shows that the models, when following a buy-and-hold strategy, made an average profit of $24,000 over a three-month real-world test period. The models seemed to opt for a buy-and-hold strategy rather than actively trading based on market fluctuations. The Bitcoin price during this period increased by 86%.

The researchers also investigated the impact of risk tolerance on trading performance. By using the probabilistic prediction outputs of the models, they created a ROC curve and determined the optimal classification threshold for each model. They then translated these thresholds into a risk tolerance parameter. The results showed differences in profit and loss values for different models when a 30% risk tolerance was specified.

In simpler terms, the evaluation of the models showed that the SVM and RFC models performed the best in terms of accuracy. The analysis of feature significance highlighted the importance of technical indicators. The trading performance analysis revealed that the models achieved a significant profit when following a buy-and-hold strategy. The investigation of risk tolerance showed that different risk tolerance levels can affect the trading performance of the models.

Potential use cases of the code and methodologies presented in this paper include developing algorithmic trading strategies for cryptocurrencies, evaluating the performance of different prediction models, and exploring the impact of risk tolerance on trading outcomes.

This snippet concludes the research paper. It discusses the trading performance of the models, limitations of the study, and future work.

The trading performance analysis shows that the Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB) model outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy, achieving a profit of over $27,000 compared to the buy-and-hold strategy's profit of $24,000. This represents a relative profit of 12.5% over the quarter for the BNB model. However, most risk tolerance values could not outperform the buy-and-hold strategy.

The paper acknowledges the limitations of the study, mentioning that results may differ when running the models using the provided code due to changes in the data used and minor procedural changes made after the evaluation period.

In conclusion, the paper proposes a new benchmark Bitcoin price forecasting process and highlights the need for a rigorous machine learning pipeline. It introduces a more realistic evaluation method through real-world trading and investigates the impact of a trader's risk tolerance on profitability. The research demonstrates the successful application of algorithmic trading models but also acknowledges the need for further exploration and improvement.
