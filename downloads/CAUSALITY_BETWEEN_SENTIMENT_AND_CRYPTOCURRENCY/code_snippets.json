It uses the Tweepy library to authenticate with the Twitter API and retrieve tweets based on a given query. The TextBlob library is then used to calculate the sentiment score for each tweet, which measures the polarity (positive or negative sentiment) and subjectivity (opinion or fact). The class provides a method `get_sentiment()` that takes a query as input and returns the average polarity and subjectivity scores for the retrieved tweets. This can be used to gauge the sentiment of Twitter users towards Bitcoin.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant CryptoSentimentAnalysis\n    participant TwitterAPI\n\n    Note right of User: Instantiate CryptoSentimentAnalysis\\nwith Twitter API keys\n    User->>CryptoSentimentAnalysis: Instantiate\\n(consumer_key, consumer_secret,\\naccess_token, access_token_secret)\n    Note right of User: Perform sentiment analysis\\non tweets related to a query\n    User->>CryptoSentimentAnalysis: get_sentiment(query)\n    CryptoSentimentAnalysis->>TwitterAPI: Search tweets\\nrelated to query\n    TwitterAPI-->>CryptoSentimentAnalysis: Return tweets\n    CryptoSentimentAnalysis-->>User: Return sentiment scores\\n(avg_polarity, avg_subjectivity)\n```\n\nThis mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. The user instantiates the `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` class with the required Twitter API keys. Then, the user invokes the `get_sentiment()` method of the `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` object, passing a query as a parameter. The `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` class communicates with the `TwitterAPI` to search for tweets related to the query. The `TwitterAPI` returns the retrieved tweets to the `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` object. Finally, the `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` object calculates the average polarity and subjectivity scores for the tweets and returns them to the user.\n\n```\nExample Scenario:\n-----------------------\nAverage polarity: 0.25\nAverage subjectivity: 0.75\n```\n\nIn this example scenario, we have used the `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` class to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to Bitcoin. The output shows an average polarity score of 0.25, indicating a slightly positive sentiment towards Bitcoin, and an average subjectivity score of 0.75, indicating that the tweets contain more opinions than factual information.\n\nHypothetical Scenarios:\n-----------------------\n- Scenario 1: During a period of high volatility in the cryptocurrency market, the sentiment analysis could be used to monitor the public sentiment towards Bitcoin. A positive sentiment might indicate increased confidence and interest in Bitcoin, potentially leading to a rise in its value.\n- Scenario 2: A major news event related to Bitcoin, such as a regulatory announcement or a security breach, could trigger a spike in negative sentiment. Monitoring sentiment in real-time could help investors and traders react quickly to market sentiment and make informed decisions about their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n-----------------------\n- Market Analysis: Sentiment analysis can be used to gauge public opinion towards cryptocurrencies, providing insights into market sentiment and potential price movements.\n- Brand Reputation: Companies operating in the cryptocurrency space can monitor sentiment to understand public perception and address any negative sentiment to protect their brand reputation.\n- Social Listening: Sentiment analysis can help researchers and analysts understand public sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, enabling them to study trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market.\n- Trading Strategies: Sentiment analysis can be used as part of a trading strategy, combining sentiment data with other market indicators to make more informed trading decisions.",

The `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` class is then used to calculate the sentiment polarity of each tweet.\n\nThe code outputs the identified topics and the sentiment polarity of each tweet.

The User specifies the number of topics.\n6. The `CryptoTopicModelling` class creates a TF-IDF matrix.\n7. The `CryptoTopicModelling` class performs K-means clustering on the TF-IDF matrix.\n8. The `CryptoTopicModelling` class retrieves the top terms for each cluster.\n9. The `CryptoTopicModelling` class returns the identified topics to the User.\n10. The User analyzes the sentiment of each tweet using the `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` class.\n11. The `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` class calculates the sentiment polarity of each tweet.\n12. The `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` class returns the sentiment polarity for each tweet to the User.\n\nThis sequence of steps allows the User to extract topics from a set of tweets and determine the sentiment expressed in each tweet.\n\nExample scenario:\n\nLet's say we have a set of tweets related to cryptocurrency:\n\n```\ntweets = [\n    \"Bitcoin is the future of currency\",\n    \"I invested in cryptocurrency and made a profit\",\n    \"Regulations on crypto are increasing\",\n    \"The media coverage of cryptocurrency is misleading\",\n    \"Blockchain technology is revolutionary\"\n]\n```\n\nWe want to extract the top topics from these tweets and analyze the sentiment expressed in each tweet.\n\nMocked log output:\n\n```\nTopics:\nTopic 1: ['cryptocurrency', 'future', 'bitcoin', 'currency', 'invested']\nTopic 2: ['media', 'coverage', 'misleading', 'cryptocurrency', 'regulations']\nTopic 3: ['blockchain', 'technology', 'revolutionary', 'cryptocurrency', 'currency']\n\nSentiment of 'Bitcoin is the future of currency': 0.0\nSentiment of 'I invested in cryptocurrency and made a profit': 0.5\nSentiment of 'Regulations on crypto are increasing': 0.0\nSentiment of 'The media coverage of cryptocurrency is misleading': -0.5\nSentiment of 'Blockchain technology is revolutionary': 1.0\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this example, the `CryptoTopicModelling` class is used to extract the top topics from the tweets. The `get_topics()` method is called with `num_topics=3`, so it identifies three main topics from the tweets: \"Topic 1\" related to the future and investment in cryptocurrency, \"Topic 2\" related to media coverage and regulations of cryptocurrency, and \"Topic 3\" related to the revolutionary nature of blockchain technology.\n\nThe `CryptoSentimentAnalysis` class is then used to analyze the sentiment expressed in each tweet. The `get_sentiment()` method returns a sentiment polarity score between -1 and 1. A score of 0 indicates a neutral sentiment, positive scores indicate positive sentiment, and negative scores indicate negative sentiment.\n\nIn this scenario, the sentiment analysis reveals that the first and third tweets have a sentiment score of 0, indicating a neutral sentiment. The second tweet expresses a positive sentiment with a score of 0.5, while the fourth tweet expresses a negative sentiment with a score of -0.5. Lastly, the fifth tweet expresses a highly positive sentiment with a score of 1.0.\n\nPotential use cases:\n\n- Market analysis: By analyzing the topics and sentiment in tweets related to cryptocurrency, companies and investors can gain insights into market trends and sentiment towards specific cryptocurrencies.\n- Social media monitoring: Organizations can use the code to monitor and analyze the sentiment of tweets related to their cryptocurrency products or services, helping them understand public perception and make data-driven decisions.\n- Trend detection: By identifying the top topics in tweets, this code can help detect emerging trends and popular discussions in the cryptocurrency space.\n- Content generation: The identified topics can serve as inspiration for creating relevant content related to cryptocurrency, such as blog posts or social media updates.\n- Risk assessment: By monitoring the sentiment expressed in tweets, this code can help assess the potential risks associated with cryptocurrency investments based on the general sentiment of the public.",
