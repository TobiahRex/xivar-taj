ABSTRACT
We propose a novel portfolio trading system, which contains a
feature preprocessing module and a trading module. The feature
preprocessing module consists of various data processing opera-
tions, while in the trading part, we integrate the portfolio weight
rebalance function with the trading algorithm and make the trad-
ing system fully automated and suitable for individual investors,
holding a handful of stocks. The data preprocessing procedures are
applied to remove the white noise in the raw data set and uncover
the general pattern underlying the data set before the processed
feature set is inputted into the trading algorithm. Our empirical
results reveal that the proposed portfolio trading system can effi-
ciently earn high profit and maintain a relatively low drawdown,
which clearly outperforms other portfolio trading strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION
Portfolio trading usually aims to maximize the return over time
and minimize the investment risk simultaneously. Investors typ-
ically gain profits by dynamically allocating their wealth among
selected assets at the initial period and rebalancing their wealth af-
terwards. With the fast development of machine learning in recent
years, portfolio trading has been extensively studied in the machine

ment learning (RRL) algorithms to optimize trading systems and
the algorithm was extended to optimize portfolios consisting of the
S&P 500 Stock Index and T-Bills [ 17]. Afterwards, other researchers
followed their scheme with certain variations. [ 8] applied RRL to
the strategic asset allocation on samples from various countries.
They only consider a portfolio consisting of 2 assets, long-term
bond and equity and let the portfolio weight of one asset 𝑤𝑡depend
on the parameters of the RRL algorithm by a heuristic equation
in the economic context. [ 15] constructed a portfolio consisting of
12 stocks and let the position of each stock, long (1) or short (-1),
be decided by the trading signal from each stock trading system,
which was driven by the proposed regime-switching RRL. Also, [ 2]
combined the RRL trading algorithm with the Calmar ratio to do the
portfolio rebalance. They used the RRL algorithm to optimize the
Calmar ratio instead of Sharpe ratio to generate the trading signals
or positions of each asset, then the portfolio weight was decided by
an exogenous softmax function based on the trading signal of each
asset. On the other hand, online learning has also been broadly
applied to select portfolios. [ 13] proposed passive aggressive mean
reversion strategy, which constructed portfolios to minimize the
deviation from the last portfolio. [ 12] exploited the mean reversion
and variance information of portfolios and proposed the confidence
weighted mean reversion strategy. Additionally, [ 11] proposed the
on-line portfolio selection with moving average reversion (OLMAR)
strategy, which used the moving average reversion pattern of stock
price relatives. A notable difference between the portfolio selec-
tion algorithm driven by RRL and online learning is that online
learning techniques allow more assets to be included in a portfolio
than the reinforcement learning algorithm does. Other machine
learning techniques and models have also been applied in portfolio
selection. For instance, [ 3] developed a novel portfolio selection
approach using a machine learning algorithm, eXtreme Gradient
Boosting with an improved firely algorithm, and the mean-variance
portfolio choice theory [ 16]. A mixed portfolio formation approach
was proposed in [ 22], which used the long-short term memory net-
works to preselect stocks with high potential return and then the
mean-variance model was applied to do the portfolio construction
with the chosen stocks. Additionally, support vector machine and
mean-variance model were combined to select portfolios in [5].
Amongst these machine learning portfolio selection models, we
are particularly interested in RRL models, because it lays the ground
for automated trading where the trading signals of each asset over
the investment horizon are directly generated and its characteristics
make it more suitable for individual investors. However, all these
previous work about portfolio selection or trading mainly focus on
building various machine learning algorithms to boost the modelICAIF’21, November 3–5, 2021, Virtual Event, USA Lin Li
performance. To the best of our knowledge, few work has been
dedicated to improving the feature quality before implementing the
trading algorithms. In this paper, we build an automated portfolio
selection system, named PCA&DWT RRL, based on RRL and two
main data preprocessing approaches, Principal Component Analy-
sis (PCA) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The PCA&DWT
RRL system is driven by the RRL algorithm that aims to maximize
the risk-adjusted return and contains some auxiliary components
for feature processing. Specifically, the data set containing the daily
close price and volume from each stock is firstly preprocessed to
extract various technical indicators which are then further prepro-
cessed by PCA and DWT techniques to form the feature series for
each stock. Then the daily feature streams of various indicators
are combined into one dataframe for each stock. Then for each
period, the daily feature vectors of various stocks are concatenated
as one element of the final feature set which is inputted into the
RRL algorithm to generate portfolio weights at each trading period.
Our contributions are: 1, we embed the portfolio rebalance func-
tion into the RRL trading algorithm and the adjustment of portfolio
weight is internally automated, which differentiates our approach
from other portfolio trading methods based on RRL. 2, we integrate
several data preprocessing steps with the trading algorithm, which
ensures a high quality of the feature set for trading. 3, we have done
extensive experiments to test the performance of PCA&DWT RRL
system and the empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
system consistently outperforms other benchmark portfolio selec-
tion strategies. Moreover, we find that feature preprocessing plays
a vital role in this setting.
2 DATA PREPROCESSING MODULE
2.1 Data Configuration Layer
In the financial market, the price of stocks is affected by multiple
factors which include but not limited to unexpected events, govern-
ment policies and company activities. This implies that there may
be a few periods when trading activities are not available, which
results in a couple of NA entries in the price time series. These
NAs are useless for our trading system and can be removed directly
or filled out with other values subject to specific learning task. In
our case, we discard these NAs directly for simplicity. Note that
removing NA entries may result in irregular samples in timeline
for different stocks. Hence, here we make sure the length of sample
points is the same for all stocks and assume they are of the same
timeline.
Technical analysis in the financial market has a long history
amongst investment practitioners. However, it was omitted by aca-
demics over a few decades in the past probably due to the belief of
efficient market hypothesis. As more and more evidence shows that
markets are not as efficient as once believed. Technical analysis
were applied to algorithmic trading [ 4,20]. It is generally believed
that technical analysis indicators can summarize the general pattern
of the time series and avoid local noise in the data stream, which
can further be utilized by the trading system to make profitable
decisions. There are quite a few technical indicators developed by
financial professionals [ 1]. One can choose various technical indi-
cators to use depending on specific tasks. While without enough
number of indicators, it may be tough to reveal the pattern of thedata stream comprehensively, including too many technical indica-
tors may also affect the trading decision negatively and increase the
computation burden, since the calculated value of some technical
indicators are not always consistent with one another. Given this,
the indicators selected in this paper can be categorized into four
groups with the hope to reflect the overall history information of
specific stocks, momentum indicators: Momentum (MOM), Mov-
ing Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Money Flow Index
(MFI), Relative Strength Index (RSI), volatility indicators: Average
True Range (ATR), Normalized Average True Range (NATR), cycle
indicators: Hilbert Transform Dominant Cycle Phase (HTDCP),
Hilbert Transform Sinewave (HTS), Hilbert Transform Trend Mar-
ket Mode (HTTMM) and volume indicators: Chaikin Oscillator (CO),
On Balance Volume (OBV). We select these technical indicators due
to Let𝑇𝐴= {MOM, MACD, MFI, RSI, ATR, NATR, HTDCP, HTS,
HTTMM, CO, OBV} denote the set of 11 technical indicators used
for the following exposition. The calculation of technical indicators
was done via the python library TA-Lib [6].
Additionally, to make the value of each feature on the same scale,
we normalize each technical indicator stream with the standard
normalization, i.e. z-score to process each technical indicator series,
which is represented by the following equation.
𝑋=𝑋−𝜇(𝑋)
𝜎(𝑋)(1)
where𝑋is the time series of each extracted feature, 𝜇(𝑋)and𝜎(𝑋)
is the mean and standard deviation of 𝑋, respectively.
2.2 Principal Component Analysis Layer
The PCA layer of data preprocessing module receives the normal-
ized feature set, including 11 technical indicators data streams, as
input. The development of PCA originates from the curse of di-
mensionality which claims that data points in high dimension lie
far away from each other, statistically speaking [ 7]. The curse of
dimensionality not only makes the training of machine learning
algorithm expensive, but also casts a shadow over the predictions
of the trained algorithm, since data points in-sample and out-of-
sample are so far away. In order to alleviate the effect of curse of
dimensionality, a natural way is to reduce the dimension of data
sets. That is where PCA comes into effect. To be more specific,
PCA firstly fits the input, identifying the main components that
represent the directions of maximum variance of the input. Then
the main components are ordered according to the variance they
explain and one can choose how many components are preserved.
Afterwards, the original input is projected onto the retained com-
ponents, resulting in a data set of lower dimension. In our case,
the normalized technical indicators is a 11 dimensional data set at
first. After being decomposed by PCA, there will be less than 11
indicators, reducing the probability of correlation and inconsistency
amongst different technical indicators. In this way, the processed
𝑇𝐴set results in a new 𝑇𝐴′⊂𝑇𝐴. Note that different stocks may
have different components of technical indicators retained in 𝑇𝐴′.
Here we only need to make sure that the cardinality of 𝑇𝐴′s is the
same for all stocks to meet the logic of the RRL trading algorithm
afterwards. We use the well developed Scikit-learn [ 21] library to
implement the PCA operation. Additionally, we set the hyperpa-
rameter, explained variance ratio, to 95% which means that theAn Automated Portfolio Trading System with Feature Preprocessing and Recurrent Reinforcement Learning ICAIF’21, November 3–5, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
sum of the variance explained by all retained principal components
takes up at least 95% of the total variance of the original data set.
2.3 Discrete Wavelet Transform Layer
Although the data set returned by the PCA layer is simplified by
removing less relevant features in the feature domain, some outliers
or irrelevant data points, representing local noise, may still exist
in each feature series. They may affect the training and trading of
the RRL algorithm. To remove these local noise in the time domain
of each indicator, we apply the discrete wavelet transform to the
feature data after being processed by PCA.
Reference [ 14] proposed to calculate the DWT coefficients, in-
cluding the approximation and the detail coefficients, using a pair
of high pass and low-pass filter. In the algorithm, the father Φ(𝑡)
and mother Ψ(𝑡)basis functions are introduced to generate their
corresponding son Φ𝑗,𝑘(𝑡)and daughter Ψ𝑗,𝑘(𝑡)wavelets which
are further utilized to approximate the original signal. The cor-
responding coefficients of son and daughter wavelets as a result
of decomposing a function 𝑓(𝑥)is defined in the following inner
product form [14].
𝑎𝑗,𝑘=⟨𝑓(𝑡),Φ𝑗,𝑘(𝑡)⟩, 𝑑𝑗,𝑘=⟨𝑓(𝑡),Ψ𝑗,𝑘(𝑡)⟩ (2)
where𝑎𝑗,𝑘and𝑑𝑗,𝑘are approximation and detail coefficients, re-
spectively, and 𝑘=0,1,2,...and𝑗=0,1,2,.... Though there are
various types of wavelets, in this work, we use Haar wavelets with
periodization padding mode, since Haar wavelets are useful to cap-
ture fluctuations between adjacent observations, recorded by [ 9],
which would be heuristically useful to spot evident drawdowns
in the financial market. Additionally, the decomposition can be
iterated for multiple times, subject to the inherent decomposition
level of the wavelets and the length of the signal or data series.
Eventually, the DWT leaves us one set of the approximation
coefficients and a couple of sets of the detail coefficients depending
on the given decomposition level. In this paper, we set the DWT
decomposition level equal to 4, since too high decomposition level
would destroy the general pattern, while too low would still leave
too much noise in the data [ 10]. After the decomposition finishes,
the general trend of the original signal is preserved in the approxi-
mation set, while the detail coefficients sets contain the local noise
of the signal [ 14], which we aim to clean. At this point, we apply
soft thresholding technique with an empirical threshold value equal
to two times standard deviations of coefficients to each detail coef-
ficients set. Eventually, the inverse DWT method is used to recon-
struct the signal which is the final denoised version of the original
signal. By discarding the irrelevant coefficients, the reconstructed
signal represents the essential characteristics of the original signal,
which is further adopted by the RRL trader in the following trading
module. The DWT process for each technical indicator series of
each asset is implemented with the open source python package
PyWavelets [ 10]. Note that here parameters for DWT are kept the
same for the PCA-transformed technical indicators.3 RECURRENT REINFORCEMENT
LEARNING FOR PORTFOLIO TRADING
MODULE
3.1 Portfolio Rebalance Function
In this paper, we assume that the trader takes only long positions
and there is no income or consumptions. At the beginning of each
period, the trader rebalances the portfolio which is composed of
several securities with corresponding weights. Assuming there are
𝑚securities with price series {{𝑝𝑎
𝑡}:𝑎=1,...,𝑚}, the market rate
of return𝑟𝑎
𝑡for price series 𝑝𝑎
𝑡for the period ending at time 𝑡is
defined as𝑟𝑎
𝑡=𝑝𝑎
𝑡
𝑝𝑎
𝑡−1−1and thus the return vector of 𝑚securities
is defined as 𝒓𝑡=[𝑟1
𝑡,𝑟2

𝑎𝑡ℎsecurity at period 𝑡as𝐹𝑎
𝑡,𝑭𝑡=[𝐹1

𝑡]⊤and the vector
1=[1,1,...,1]⊤, then the trader that takes only long positions must
have portfolio weights that satisfy:
𝑭⊤
𝑡·1=1,𝑭𝑡≥0 (3)
Given these conditions, we use the following normalized outputs
as portfolio weights:
𝑭𝑡=exp[𝒇𝑡(𝒀𝑡)]
1⊤·exp[𝒇𝑡(𝒀𝑡)](4)
which is suggested by [ 18,19] and 𝒇𝑡is defined using hyperbolic
tangent activation function as:
𝒇𝑡(𝒀𝑡)=tanh(𝒀𝑡) (5)
𝒀𝑡=(𝑿𝑡⊗𝚯)·1 (6)
where 𝑿𝑡=[𝒙1
𝑡,𝒙2
𝑡,...,𝒙𝑚
𝑡]⊤is the input feature matrix to the
trading system, while 𝚯=[𝜽1,𝜽2,...,𝜽𝑚]⊤is the system param-
eter matrix to be learned during the training process, and ⊗rep-
resents the element-wise product between matrices. Note that all
elements of matrices 𝑿𝑡and𝚯are vectors per se, in particular,

of technical indicators remained in 𝑇𝐴′at period𝑡for security 𝑎
and𝑛is the cardinality of the 𝑇𝐴′set.
3.2 Profit of Portfolio Tradings
Since𝐹𝑎
𝑡represents the holdings of security 𝑎at period𝑡, then𝐹𝑎
𝑡
should be re-adjusted at each time step according to Equation 4.
Thus, generally speaking, a transaction cost rate 𝛿should be applied
to each security weight adjustment between two consecutive peri-
ods. One can arguably expect that higher transaction costs would
discourage the excessive rebalance actions [ 17]. Since our focus is
the systematic construction of the trading system, we here assume
the influence of price series movements on portfolio weights is
negligible for the ease of exposition and analysis. In this case, the
wealth of the trading at time 𝑇is:
𝑊𝑇=𝑊0𝑇Ö
𝑡=1(1+𝑅𝑡)
=𝑊0𝑇Ö
𝑡=1(1+𝑭⊤
𝑡−1𝒓𝑡)(1−𝛿·1⊤|𝑭𝑡−𝑭𝑡−1|)(7)
where𝑊0is the initial wealth of the investment account, which we
set as $1 for simplicity, and 𝑅𝑡is the return of the portfolio at timeICAIF’21, November 3–5, 2021, Virtual Event, USA Lin Li
𝑡i.e. one-stage profit, defined as:
𝑅𝑡=(1+𝑭⊤
𝑡−1𝒓𝑡)(1−𝛿·1⊤|𝑭𝑡−𝑭𝑡−1|)−1 (8)
In this case, the cumulative profit obtained from the investment
after𝑇periods is:
𝑃𝑇=𝑊𝑇−𝑊0 (9)
3.3 Sharpe Ratio
In this paper, we aim to optimize the risk-adjusted return of the
portfolio (e.g. Sharpe ratio) among other performance criteria, since
it is relatively simple and widely adopted by various investors. The
Sharpe ratio is commonly defined as the ratio between the average
and standard deviation of a period of historical returns, 𝑅1,...,𝑇 [17],
where𝑅𝑡is the return of investment at trading period 𝑡. Intuitively,
Sharpe ratio rewards investment strategies that are less volatile to
make profits.
3.4 Gradient Ascent
To obtain the optimal portfolio rebalance strategy, the RRL algo-
rithm needs to learn the optimal parameters via maximizing Sharpe
ratio of the portfolio. Therefore, one needs to evaluate the influence
of Sharpe ratio on the portfolio trading system during training. We
attain this goal by computing the first order derivative of Sharpe
ratio with respect to (w.r.t.) 𝚯. Furthermore, we adopt the gradient
ascent to update the model parameters learned during training.
Although automatic differentiation is easily available, we include
technical details here for the reference of implementation, especially
for readers with little background in machine learning.
First of all, with the estimate of the first and second moments of
returns distributions, one has the Sharpe ratio formula of a portfolio
as follows [17]:
𝑆𝑇=𝐸[𝑅1,...,𝑇]√︃
𝐸[𝑅2
1,...,𝑇]−(𝐸[𝑅1,...,𝑇])2=𝐴√

Where𝐴=1

system parameters is computed using the chain rule:

can be chosen such that Sharpe ratio has converged during training.
Note that optimizing Sharpe ratio requires to calculate the gradient
of Sharpe ratio w.r.t. 𝚯which depends on the total derivative of

𝜕𝚯. Therefore, we adopt an efficient recurrent algorithm similar
to backpropagation through time (BPTT) to train the model, as in

Based on what we discussed before, we design Algorithm 1 to
train our model, which aims to obtain the optimized system param-
eter matrix 𝚯∗𝑛. Then, 𝚯∗𝑛is directly applied to the same algorithm
within one training epoch with the test/trading window size 𝑀,
which gives us the out-of-sample result of the PCA&DWT RRL
method. Afterwards, the training and trading processes are repeated
forward until the last batch of trading periods. A graphical repre-
sentation of the rolling training and test is given in Figure 1. When
training, the agent is trained for 𝑁epochs and the process is early
stopped if the objective value is not improved in two consecutive
epochs. This is also to avoid overfitting of the RRL algorithm and
ensure a better generalization ability of the algorithm. Note the
value of𝑇and𝑀can be fine-tuned to fit the market structure un-
derlying different stock price patterns, which should improve the
performance theoretically, if there is a similar market pattern in
the rolling training and trading windows.

4 EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Data Sets
We test the proposed portfolio trading system on real data sets
composed of different number of stocks. As to the number of stocks
in a portfolio, we notice that many studies considered a portfolio
with less than ten stocks [ 2,3,22] and holding too many different
stocks is tough to manage for individual investors. [ 5] argued that
a portfolio with 7 assets is more appropriate than others for port-
folio selection under the machine learning context. Therefore, we
construct portfolios with cardinality 𝑘=4,5,6,7,8using different
stocks as different data sets which are then inputted to the trading
algorithm to uncover sequential portfolio weights. Specifically, we
randomly choose 8 different stocks with ticker symbols XOM, VZ,
NKE, AMAT, MCD, MSFT, AAP and NOV from S&P500 index which
is arguably representative of the general stock market condition in
the US, then we form portfolios with different cardinalities using
these stocks. Note that due to the RRL trading algorithm where
Jacobian matrices are calculated, the order of different stocks in a
portfolio matters. However, our empirical results find that the ef-
fect of stock orders is not significant. Therefore, we form portfolios
with the listed stocks order one by one without loss of generality.
For each stock, five data streams are collected from Yahoo Finance

4.2 Performance Metrics
The metrics used to measure the performance of the proposed port-
folio trading system in the real financial market are: Net Profit (NP)
which is final wealth 𝑊𝑇accumulated by the RRL trading over all
the trading periods minus the initial wealth 𝑊0; Annualized Per-
centage Yield (APY), representing the annualized percentage gain;
Annualized Sharpe Ratio (ASR), representing the annualized risk
adjusted return and we assume the risk-free return is 4% per annum
and there are 252 trading days each year; Maximum Drawdown

(MDD) which measures the profit decline percentage from peak
value (PV) before largest drop and lowest value (LV) before new

Ratio (CR), indicating the level of risk taken to achieve a return and
a higher CR suggests that the system’s return is not at the risk of
large drawdowns and vice verse. The higher the numerical value
of all these metrics are, the better the performance of the trading
system is except for MDD for which a lower value is preferred, since
most investors are risk-averse. The definitions for these metrics are
summarized in Table 2.
4.3 Benchmark Strategies
A way to show the efficiency of the proposed portfolio trading
system would be to compare the performance of the system with
other benchmark methods. In this paper, we compare the proposed
trading method with the baseline, Uniform Constant Rebalanced
Portfolios (UCRP), which rebalances to a uniform portfolio with
equal weight of each stock at the beginning of every period [ 11];
OLMAR, which is representative of the notable online portfolio
selection techniques in recent years [ 11]; the mean-variance port-
folio selection model (MV), which utilizes the Monte Carlo method
to generate different portfolios, that is, randomly create a set of
weights and calculate the mean and variance of each portfolio under
the weight, then choose the corresponding weight with the highest
Sharpe ratio to allocate wealth for each period over the horizon
[2,3,5,22]. Note that the mean-variance portfolio choice theory
[16] usually aims for single period portfolio selection, researchers
sometimes assume that the obtained portfolio weight is optimal
for the entire investment horizon in hindsight, which may be not
true. We also compare the proposed method with the original RRL
trading method (LAG RRL) which simply uses the lagged historical
daily return of each stock as features plus a RRL trading module
[17]. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the effect of using PCA
and DWT techniques, we also present the results of the proposed
method without PCA and DWT layers (TA RRL).4.4 Hyperparameters
A common feature of most machine learning models is that their per-
formance highly depends on the setting of hyperparameters which
are parameters set before the training process begins. In our case,
the performance of the trading system is similarly affected by hyper-
parameters from each module of the system. Besides the hyparame-
ters described before in the data preprocessing module of the system,
hyperparameters of the RRL trading module also matter. Further-
more, theoretically speaking, for each feature set, there is an optimal
set of hyperparameters associated. However, due to multiple factors,
such as the big number of hyperparameters, the large value space
of each hyperparameter and the interdependence amongst different
hyperparameters, determination of the optimal set of hyperparam-
eters is almost impossible. Even if one could find the optimal set of
hyperparameters for one data set, these hyperparameters is most
likely to be sub-optimal for other data sets. Therefore, in this paper,
the value of hyperparameters of the proposed portfolio trading sys-
tem is set empirically to try to ensure an overall good performance
on all data sets, unless otherwise stated. Specifically, besides the
hyperparameter in the data preprocessing module, we empirically
fix𝑇=100,𝜌=0.1,𝜆=0.01,𝛿=0.001,𝑁=100,𝜅=42,𝜖=0
and the rolling trading window size 𝑀=100. Note that in terms
of the transaction cost, this paper only considers brokerage cost
as it is directly controlled by individual investors. Referring to pa-
rameter setting of several empirical research [ 2,22], we decide to
simulate the transaction cost as 𝛿=0.001or10bps without loss
of generality for all listed strategies. Moverover, to ensure a fair
comparison, we make the shared hyperparameters same for three
RRL based strategies and the LAG RRL is additionally fine-tuned in
its lagged length of return series, while OLMAR is also fine-tuned
in its hyperparameters, reversion threshold and look-back window
and we use Monte Carlo method to simulate 50,000 different sets of
portfolio weights for the MV strategy, which would arguably cover
most possible portfolios, from statistical point of view [3, 22].
4.5 Numerical Results
While UCRP and MV are passive investment strategies whose prof-
its are mostly determined by the movement of the underlying assets’
price, the other methods are active in taking actions in markets.
The numerical results of all strategies’ performance are presented
in Table 3 with the best results obtained by all strategies on each
portfolio stressed in bold face. Additionally, Figure 2 presents these
numerical results with boxplots.
By examining the obtained results, it is apparent that the pro-
posed trading system clearly outperforms all other strategies in
term of almost all metrics on portfolios with different cardinalities.
Specifically, the PCA&DWT RRL earns the highest NP, APY, ASR,
CR and lowest MDD, except for the MDD of the portfolio contain-
ing 5 stocks, than others on various portfolios, which shows that
this portfolio trading system is not only effective but superior to
the benchmark in most cases. Secondly, PCA&DWT RRL substan-
tially outperforms other two RRL based strategies, meaning that
combining PCA and DWT techniques implemented on technical
indicators plays an important role in improving the performance
of the trading system. Especially, feature preprocessing is vital for
RRL trading algorithm. Thirdly, it is found that UCRP and MV areAn Automated Portfolio Trading System with Feature Preprocessing and Recurrent Reinforcement Learning ICAIF’21, November 3–5, 2021, Virtual Event, USA

relatively good strategies except PCA&DWT RRL, revealing fol-
lowing the market is always a viable strategy, while OLMAR is less
competitive on these data sets, which seems to verify that OLMAR
is more adapted to large portfolios management.
Finally, we test the performance of all strategies w.r.t. transaction
costs. Given many online brokers provide free stock trading, we
set𝛿as 0 bps, 10 bps and 50 bps, respectively, per share for more
general settings. Figure 3 presents the trend of gross cumulative
profits𝑊𝑇of different strategies w.r.t. various portfolios with 𝛿=0,
while Figure 4 and 5 reveal the performance with 𝛿=30 bps and 50
bps, respectively. It is clear that the proposed system is negatively
affected by transaction costs, since on each particular portfolio,
the higher the transaction cost rate is, the lower the final cumula-
tive profit obtained by PCA&DWT RRL strategy. On the contrary,
passive investment strategies, UCRP and MV, are less affected by
transaction costs, since they just need to rebalance the portfolio af-
fected by the underlying stocks price movement which is normally
tiny. However, on most portfolios, especially when the transaction
cost rates are low, PCA&DWT RRL system significantly outper-
forms all other benchmark strategies in gross profits, which reveals
that the proposed trading system is robust, consistent and competi-
tive in making profits compared to other strategies. Nevertheless,
the proposed strategy seems to be unsuitable for large portfolios
trading since all figures show that the more stocks contained in
a portfolio, the less the profit gained by our strategy with other
hyperparameters fixed.

5 CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a novel portfolio trading system, PCA&DWT
RRL, which not only embeds the portfolio rebalance function into
the algorithm to trade portfolios at each period directly, but also
combines PCA and DWT to preprocess the technical indicators
extracted from the original stock price and volume data. The exper-
imental results demonstrate that the proposed system consistently
outperforms other portfolio selection strategies from previous liter-
ature. Moreover, we find that feature preprocessing is vital for the
RRL trading algorithm in this setting. Future research could exploit
more about the portfolio rebalance function to further improve
the performance and make the system more adapted to large-scale
portfolio selections for financial institutions.
