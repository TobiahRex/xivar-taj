Scaling Transformer to 1M tokens and beyond with Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT)

1.
This technical report is about a new method called Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) that extends the capabilities of a popular language processing model called BERT.
 The RMT allows the model to remember and process much longer sequences of words, up to 2 million tokens, compared to previous models like GPT-4 and CoLT5 which can only handle up to 32,000 and 64,000 tokens, respectively.


The RMT works by adding a memory component to the BERT model.
 This memory allows the model to store and retrieve information from previous segments of the input sequence.
 By using recurrence, the model can effectively utilize this memory to process very long sequences.


The report explains that the Transformer model, which is the basis for BERT, has a problem with quadratic complexity, meaning that it becomes more difficult to process longer inputs.
 However, the RMT overcomes this problem by using a token-based memory mechanism.


The report also describes the contributions of the RMT, including enhancing BERT with memory storage and recurrence, demonstrating the model's ability to handle longer sequences, and analyzing the attention patterns used by the RMT.


Overall, the RMT is a new method that improves the capabilities of language processing models like BERT, allowing them to handle much longer sequences of words and process information more effectively.
 This has the potential to enhance tasks like understanding and generating natural language and enable memory-intensive applications.

This snippet discusses the implementation details and computational efficiency of the Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) model.
 The RMT is designed to work with any model from the Transformer family, such as the OPT model family mentioned in the snippet.


The RMT uses memory tokens to store information from previous segments of the input sequence.
 The memory tokens are updated during the forward pass of the model.
 The outputs of the memory tokens from the current segment are passed as inputs to the next segment, creating a recurrent connection.


One advantage of the RMT is its computational efficiency.
 The snippet shows that the RMT scales linearly with respect to the input sequence length.
 This means that as the length of the input sequence increases, the computational requirements of the RMT increase proportionally.
 This is in contrast to non-recurrent models, which tend to exhibit quadratic scaling, meaning that the computational requirements increase exponentially with the input sequence length.


The snippet also mentions that the RMT can reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) compared to non-recurrent models.
 This reduction in FLOPs can be significant, especially for larger models like OPT-175B, where the RMT can reduce the number of FLOPs by up to 295 times.


Additionally, the snippet briefly mentions the use of the RMT in memorization tasks.
 Synthetic datasets are created where the model needs to memorize facts and use them to answer questions.
 The RMT is tested on these tasks to evaluate its memorization abilities.


Overall, the snippet provides insights into the implementation and efficiency of the RMT model, highlighting its ability to handle longer input sequences and reduce computational requirements compared to non-recurrent models.


3.
This snippet describes the synthetic tasks used to evaluate the capabilities of the Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) model.
 These tasks involve fact memorization, fact detection and memorization, and reasoning with memorized facts.


In the fact memorization task, the RMT is tested on its ability to store and remember information over an extended period of time.
 The fact is always located at the beginning of the input sequence, and the question is always at the end.
 The model needs to separate the relevant fact from the irrelevant text and use it to answer the question.


In the fact detection and memorization task, the fact is randomly placed within the text sequence, making it more challenging for the model to detect and store it in memory.
 The model needs to identify the fact, write it to memory, and later use it to answer the question.


In the reasoning with memorized facts task, two facts are generated and positioned randomly within the input sequence.
 The question posed at the end of the sequence requires the model to use one of the memorized facts to answer correctly.


These tasks evaluate the RMT's ability to handle memory-intensive tasks, such as storing and retrieving information, detecting relevant facts, and reasoning with the help of memorized facts.


The snippet also briefly mentions the experiments conducted using the pretrained bert-base-cased model as the backbone for the RMT.
 These experiments involved training and evaluating the RMT on different tasks using multiple GPUs.


Overall, the snippet provides an overview of the synthetic tasks used to evaluate the RMT's performance in memory-intensive scenarios and the experimental setup used to train and evaluate the model.

This snippet discusses the experimental results and related work of the Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) model.


In terms of experimental results, the snippet mentions the benefits of using a training schedule, which improves the accuracy and stability of the RMT model.
 It also highlights the extrapolation abilities of the RMT, showing that the model can generalize well to longer sequences when trained on a sufficient number of segments.


The snippet further describes the attention patterns observed during memory operations.
 By examining the attention maps, it is observed that memory operations correspond to specific patterns in attention.
 This demonstrates the effectiveness of the learned memory operations, even on extremely long sequences.


In terms of related work, the snippet mentions the concept of memory in neural architectures.
 It refers to early works in neural network research and advancements in memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) and Memory Networks.
 These models utilize external memory separate from the model's parameters to enable reasoning and sequential attention over memory content.


The snippet also mentions the combination of memory with Transformers in a recurrent approach.
 Models like Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer divide long inputs into smaller segments and process them sequentially with memory to access information from past segments.


Overall, the snippet provides insights into the experimental findings of the RMT model and discusses related work in the field of memory in neural architectures.


5.
This snippet discusses related work in the field of memory in neural architectures and provides a discussion of the findings of the Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) model.


The related work section mentions various approaches that incorporate memory into neural architectures.
 These include methods like Memformer, MART, FeedBack Transformer, and others that introduce memory modules or recurrent connections to improve information flow and handle long-range dependencies.
 Some approaches, like Star-Transformer, Longformer, GMAT, ETC, and Big Bird, limit attention distance and employ techniques to preserve long-range dependencies.
 Memory Transformer extends the model input with memory tokens, and Memorizing Transformers further extend memory through k-NN lookup.


The discussion highlights that many existing recurrent methods require architectural modifications and have memory requirements that grow with input size, which can limit input scaling due to hardware constraints.
 However, the RMT model demonstrates that a recurrent approach and memory can reduce the quadratic complexity of Transformers to linear complexity.
 It also shows that models trained on sufficiently large inputs can extrapolate their abilities to handle much longer texts.


The snippet concludes by mentioning that the synthetic tasks explored in the study serve as a starting point for the RMT model to generalize to tasks with unseen properties, including language modeling.
 Future work aims to tailor the recurrent memory approach to commonly used Transformers to improve their effective context size.


Overall, the snippet provides an overview of related work in memory-based neural architectures and highlights the significance of the RMT model in addressing the challenges of long inputs in Transformers.
