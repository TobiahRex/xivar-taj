It has methods to add trade triggers and exit rules for different time frames (e.g., 5m, 1h) and to enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame. The `update_primary_time_frame` method allows changing the primary time frame.\n\nIn the example usage, we create an instance of `BlackBoxTradingSystem` and add trade triggers and exit rules for the 5m and 1h charts. Then, we enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart.\n\nThis class provides a simplified implementation to demonstrate the concept of the black box trading system and can be expanded upon to include additional functionality and conditions based on the specific requirements of the system.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant bbts: BlackBoxTradingSystem\n\n    User->>bbts: add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\n    User->>bbts: add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n    \n    User->>bbts: add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\n    User->>bbts: add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\n    User->>bbts: enter_trade()\n    bbts->>bbts: Check trade triggers\n    bbts-->>User: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n    User->>bbts: exit_trade()\n    bbts->>bbts: Check exit rules\n    bbts-->>User: Exit trade based on 1m chart\n    \n    User->>bbts: update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\n    \n    User->>bbts: enter_trade()\n    bbts->>bbts: Check trade triggers\n    bbts-->>User: Enter trade based on 1h chart\n\n    User->>bbts: exit_trade()\n    bbts->>bbts: Check exit rules\n    bbts-->>User: Exit trade based on 1h chart\n```\n\nThe mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. The diagram shows the interactions between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class.\n\n1. The user adds trade triggers and exit rules using the `add_trade_trigger` and `add_exit_rule` methods.\n2. The user calls the `enter_trade` method, which triggers the system to check the trade triggers.\n3. The system checks the trade triggers based on the primary time frame (initially set to 1m) and notifies the user about entering a trade based on the 1m chart.\n4. The user calls the `exit_trade` method, which triggers the system to check the exit rules.\n5. The system checks the exit rules based on the primary time frame (1m) and notifies the user about exiting the trade based on the 1m chart.\n6. The user calls the `update_primary_time_frame` method to change the primary time frame to 1h.\n7. The user then calls the `enter_trade` method again, which triggers the system to check the trade triggers based on the updated primary time frame (1h).\n8. The system notifies the user about entering a trade based on the 1h chart.\n9. Finally, the user calls the `exit_trade` method again, which triggers the system to check the exit rules based on the primary time frame (1h). The system notifies the user about exiting the trade based on the 1h chart.\n\nThe sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow and communication between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class.\n\nExample scenario:\n\n```python\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\n# Adding trade triggers\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\n# Adding exit rules\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\n# Entering and exiting trades\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart\n\nbbts.update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart\nbbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1h chart\n```\n\nMocked log output:\n\n```\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nExit trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1h chart\nExit trade based on 1h chart\n```\n\nHypothetical scenarios explained:\n\nIn the example scenario, we create an instance of `BlackBoxTradingSystem` and add trade triggers and exit rules for the 5m and 1h charts. The trade triggers and exit rules are simplified for illustration purposes. In a real-world scenario, these conditions would be more detailed and based on specific technical analysis indicators.\n\nIn this case, the trade trigger for the 1m chart is to enter a trade when certain conditions are met. However, since we have not provided the specific conditions in the example, we assume that the conditions are met in this scenario, causing the log message \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\" to be printed.\n\nSimilarly, the exit rule for the 1m chart is triggered in this scenario, causing the log message \"Exit trade based on 1m chart\" to be printed.\n\nAfter updating the primary time frame to 1h, we repeat the process for the 1h chart. Again, the specific conditions for the trade trigger and exit rule are not provided, so we assume they are met in this scenario, resulting in the log messages \"Enter trade based on 1h chart\" and \"Exit trade based on 1h chart\" being printed.\n\nPotential use cases:\n\nThe code generated provides a foundation for building a black box trading system. It can be used in various scenarios where automated trading based on technical analysis indicators is desired. Here are a few potential use cases:\n\n1. Algorithmic trading: The code can serve as a starting point for implementing an algorithmic trading strategy that automatically enters and exits trades based on predefined conditions. Traders can customize the trade triggers and exit rules according to their specific strategies.\n\n2. Backtesting: Traders can use the code to backtest their trading strategies on historical data. By simulating trades and analyzing the outcomes, they can evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies and make necessary adjustments.\n\n3. Trading signal generation: The code can be used to generate trading signals that can be integrated into other trading systems or platforms. By implementing the trade triggers and exit rules, the code can generate signals based on the specified conditions, which can then be used to trigger trades in real-time trading systems.\n\nOverall, the code provides a flexible and customizable framework for implementing a black box trading system, allowing traders to automate their trading strategies and make data-driven trading decisions.",

The `add_confirmation` method allows adding confirmation conditions.\n\nThe `check_15m_confirmation` method is introduced to check if the 15m confirmation condition is met when entering a trade based on the 1m chart. This method is called within the `enter_trade` method when the 15m chart is active.\n\nThe `activate_15m_chart` and `disable_15m_chart` methods are included to control the activation and deactivation of the 15m chart.\n\nIn the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations.

The system checks for trade triggers on the 1m chart.\n\nThe sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the interactions between the user and the system and the flow of control in executing the methods and making trading decisions based on different conditions and time frames.\n\nExample Scenario:\n```\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\n# Adding trade triggers\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\n# Adding exit rules\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\n# Adding confirmations\nbbts.add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\n\n# Activating and disabling 15m chart\nbbts.activate_15m_chart()\n\n# Scenario 1: Trade entry based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n# Output: \"15m confirmation met\"\n\n# Scenario 2: Trade exit based on 1m chart\nbbts.exit_trade()\n# Output: \"Exit trade based on 1m chart\"\n\n# Scenario 3: Trade entry based on 1h chart\nbbts.update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: \"Enter trade based on 1h chart\"\n\n# Scenario 4: Trade exit based on 1h chart\nbbts.exit_trade()\n# Output: \"Exit trade based on 1h chart\"\n\nbbts.disable_15m_chart()\n\n# Scenario 5: Trade entry based on 1m chart without 15m confirmation\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n```\n\nExplanation of Mocked Scenarios:\n1. In the first scenario, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We activate the 15m chart. Then, we enter a trade based on the 1m chart, which triggers the trade entry and the 15m confirmation, indicating that the conditions are met for the trade.\n2. In the second scenario, we exit the trade based on the 1m chart, which triggers the trade exit.\n3. In the third scenario, we update the primary time frame to 1h. Then, we enter a trade based on the 1h chart, triggering the trade entry.\n4. In the fourth scenario, we exit the trade based on the 1h chart, triggering the trade exit.\n5. In the fifth scenario, we disable the 15m chart. Then, we enter a trade based on the 1m chart without checking the 15m confirmation since the 15m chart is disabled.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n- The code can be used in algorithmic trading systems where traders rely on automated decisions based on specific chart conditions and trade triggers.\n- It can be adapted as a framework for backtesting trading strategies, allowing traders to evaluate the past performance of various trade triggers and exit rules.\n- The code can serve as a starting point for building more complex trading systems, incorporating additional indicators, risk management rules, or machine learning algorithms.\n- Traders can use the code as a reference to understand and implement their own trading systems, tailoring the conditions and rules to their specific strategies and preferences.",

The trader is also able to set or clear the weekly start flag and the trading range flag.\n\nThe TradeTriggersList, ExitRulesList, and ConfirmationsList objects are called upon by the BlackBoxTradingSystem object to retrieve the conditions for trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations, respectively.\n\nThe diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow and interactions within the code, highlighting the steps involved in the black box trading system.\n\nExample Scenario:\n\n```python\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\n# Adding trade triggers\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\n# Adding exit rules\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\n# Adding confirmations\nbbts.add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\n\n# Activating 15m chart\nbbts.activate_15m_chart()\n\n# Setting weekly start flag\nbbts.set_weekly_start_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart (weekly start flag set)\nbbts.enter_trade()\n```\n\nMocked Log Output:\n```\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n15m confirmation met\n```\n\nHypothetical Scenario:\nIn this scenario, we have a `BlackBoxTradingSystem` object initialized with trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We activate the 15m chart and set the weekly start flag. Then, we enter a trade based on the 1m chart.\n\nExplanation:\nThe log output shows that the trade was entered based on the 1m chart. Since the weekly start flag was set, the system checks the 15m confirmation before entering the trade. In this case, the 15m confirmation condition was met, and the trade was executed accordingly.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n1. Algorithmic Trading: The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class can be used as a foundation for developing algorithmic trading strategies. Triggers and rules can be customized for specific trading algorithms and strategies.\n2. Backtesting: The class can be used to backtest trading strategies by feeding historical data and evaluating how the system would have performed in the past.\n3. Risk Management: By defining specific exit rules and profit targets, the system can help manage and automate risk management processes in trading.\n4. Strategy Development: Traders and analysts can use the class to experiment with different trade triggers, exit rules, and time frames to develop and refine new trading strategies.\n5. Real-time Trading: The class can be integrated with live market data feeds to facilitate real-time trading decisions and execution based on predefined triggers and rules.\n\nOverall, the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` provides a versatile framework for designing, testing, and implementing various trading strategies and can be adapted to meet specific trading requirements and objectives.",

It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and flags' state.\n\nHere's the mermaid sequence diagram that explains the control flow of the code provided in the previous message:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant bbts: BlackBoxTradingSystem\n\n    User -> bbts: add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\n    User -> bbts: add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n    User -> bbts: add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\n    User -> bbts: add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n    User -> bbts: add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\n    User -> bbts: update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\n    User -> bbts: activate_15m_chart()\n    User -> bbts: set_weekly_start_flag()\n    User -> bbts: enter_trade()\n    bbts -> User: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n    Note over bbts: Check if 15m chart is active\n    bbts -> User: 15m confirmation met\n    User -> bbts: exit_trade()\n    bbts -> User: Exit trade based on 1m chart\n    User -> bbts: disable_15m_chart()\n    User -> bbts: clear_weekly_start_flag()\n    User -> bbts: set_trading_range_flag()\n    User -> bbts: enter_trade()\n    bbts -> User: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n    User -> bbts: clear_trading_range_flag()\n    User -> bbts: enter_trade()\n    bbts -> User: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n```\n\nThis sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code. It starts with the user adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. Then, the user updates the primary time frame to 1h, activates the 15m chart, sets the weekly start flag, and enters a trade.\n\nThe black box trading system (`bbts`) checks if the 15m chart is active and if so, confirms the trade based on the 15m chart. Then, the system exits the trade based on the 1m chart, disables the 15m chart, clears the weekly start flag, and sets the trading range flag. The system enters another trade based on the 1m chart and clears the trading range flag.\n\nThis diagram helps visualize the sequence of steps involved in using the black box trading system and how the control flow progresses based on the different conditions and actions performed by the user.\n\nExample scenario:\n\n```python\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\n# Adding trade triggers\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\n# Adding exit rules\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\n# Adding confirmations\nbbts.add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\n\n# Setting weekly start flag\nbbts.set_weekly_start_flag()\n\n# Entering trades\nbbts.enter_trade()  # No trading signals in any timeframe due to the weekly start flag\n\n# Clearing weekly start flag\nbbts.clear_weekly_start_flag()\n\n# Activating 15m chart\nbbts.activate_15m_chart()\n\n# Entering trades\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\n# Exiting trades\nbbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Disabling 15m chart\nbbts.disable_15m_chart()\n\n# Setting trading range flag\nbbts.set_trading_range_flag()\n\n# Entering trades\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\n# Clearing trading range flag\nbbts.clear_trading_range_flag()\n\n# Entering trades\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Exiting trades\nbbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart\n```\n\nMocked log output:\n\n```\nNo trading signals in any timeframe due to the weekly start flag\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nExit trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nExit trade based on 1m chart\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we have a `BlackBoxTradingSystem` object `bbts` with added trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We start by setting the weekly start flag using the `set_weekly_start_flag()` method. When attempting to enter trades using the `enter_trade()` method, no trading signals are generated in any timeframe due to the weekly start flag being set.\n\nWe then clear the weekly start flag using the `clear_weekly_start_flag()` method. Next, we activate the 15m chart using the `activate_15m_chart()` method. When attempting to enter trades again using the `enter_trade()` method, a trade is entered based on the 1m chart and the 15m confirmation is checked.\n\nSubsequently, we exit the trade using the `exit_trade()` method based on the 1m chart. We then disable the 15m chart using the `disable_15m_chart()` method. Next, we set the trading range flag using the `set_trading_range_flag()` method.\n\nWhen attempting to enter trades once more using the `enter_trade()` method, a trade is entered based on the 1m chart and the 15m confirmation is checked. However, this time the trading range flag is set, so special rules apply. Finally, we clear the trading range flag using the `clear_trading_range_flag()` method and enter another trade based on the 1m chart.\n\nThe log output shows that trades are entered and exited based on the specified conditions and flags.\n\nPotential use cases:\n\nThe `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class can be used to implement and automate a black box trading system. Traders can define the trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations based on their specific trading strategies. The system can be easily customized to adapt to different time frames and market conditions.\n\nSome potential use cases for this code include:\n\n1. Algorithmic Trading: Implementing a black box trading system in an algorithmic trading strategy can help make automated trading decisions based on predefined rules, triggers, and confirmations.\n\n2. Technical Analysis: Traders can use the code to backtest and analyze trading strategies based on different time frames, indicators, and exit rules.\n\n3. Risk Management: The code can be integrated into risk management systems to automatically enter and exit trades based on risk parameters and predefined rules.\n\nOverall, the code provides a framework for building and testing black box trading systems and can be a valuable tool for traders looking to implement systematic and rule-based trading strategies.",

Changing time frame: We update the primary time frame to 1h, and then enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart, applying the conditions for the 1h time frame.\n\n3. Activating and disabling 15m chart: We activate the 15m chart and then enter trades based on the 1m chart, with the option to check 15m confirmation. We then disable the 15m chart and enter trades based on the 1m chart without checking the 15m confirmation.\n\n4. Setting and clearing flags: We set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, and RSI exit flag. We then enter trades based on the 1m chart, with or without checking the 15m confirmation, depending on the flag status.\n\nThese scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class to handle different time frames, entry and exit rules, and various flags that control the trading behavior. It allows for customizable trading strategies based on the specific conditions and flags set by the user.",

It shows the interaction between the `Trader` and `BBTSystem` objects and the steps involved in the trading actions.\n\n1. The `Trader` calls the `enter_trade` method on the `BBTSystem` to enter a trade based on the 1m chart.\n2. The `BBTSystem` responds by executing the trade based on the 1m chart and notifies the `Trader` of the action.\n3. The `Trader` updates the primary time frame to 1h in the `BBTSystem`.\n4. The `Trader` activates the 15m chart in the `BBTSystem`.\n5. The `Trader` disables the 15m chart in the `BBTSystem`.\n6. The `Trader` sets the weekly start flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n7. The `Trader` clears the weekly start flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n8. The `Trader` sets the trading range flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n9. The `Trader` clears the trading range flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n10. The `Trader` sets the losing trade flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n11. The `Trader` clears the losing trade flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n12. The `Trader` sets the RSI exit flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n13. The `Trader` clears the RSI exit flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n14. The `Trader` sets the acceleration phase flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n15. The `Trader` clears the acceleration phase flag in the `BBTSystem`.\n\nThe sequence diagram visually represents the control flow of the code and the interactions between the `Trader` and `BBTSystem` objects for each step. It helps illustrate how the different methods and flags are used in the trading actions.\n\nSure! Here's an example scenario with mocked log output:\n\n```python\n# Creating the BlackBoxTradingSystem instance\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\n# Adding trade triggers\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\n# Adding exit rules\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\n# Adding confirmations\nbbts.add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\n\n# Activating the 15m chart\nbbts.activate_15m_chart()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Checking 15m confirmation\nbbts.check_15m_confirmation()\n# Output: 15m confirmation met\n\n# Exiting trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.exit_trade()\n# Output: Exit trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Updating primary time frame to 1h\nbbts.update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\n\n# Entering trade based on 1h chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1h chart\n\n# Exiting trade based on 1h chart\nbbts.exit_trade()\n# Output: Exit trade based on 1h chart\n\n# Disabling the 15m chart\nbbts.disable_15m_chart()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Clearing the weekly start flag\nbbts.clear_weekly_start_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Setting the trading range flag\nbbts.set_trading_range_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Clearing the trading range flag\nbbts.clear_trading_range_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Setting the losing trade flag\nbbts.set_losing_trade_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Clearing the losing trade flag\nbbts.clear_losing_trade_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Setting the RSI exit flag\nbbts.set_rsi_exit_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Clearing the RSI exit flag\nbbts.clear_rsi_exit_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Setting the acceleration phase flag\nbbts.set_acceleration_phase_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Clearing the acceleration phase flag\nbbts.clear_acceleration_phase_flag()\n\n# Entering trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.enter_trade()\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n```\n\nIn this example scenario, we create an instance of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class and configure it with various trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then invoke the `enter_trade()` and `exit_trade()` methods multiple times, based on different time frames, flag states, and conditions.\n\nThe mocked log output shows the messages that would be generated when entering and exiting trades based on the defined conditions and flags. For example, when the 15m confirmation is met, the log output displays \"15m confirmation met\".\n\nThe hypothetical scenarios mocked in this example involve entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and flag states. The code demonstrates how the black box trading system handles different scenarios and applies the appropriate rules.\n\nPotential use cases of the code include developing and testing trading strategies using different time frames, incorporating specific triggers and exits, and managing trade decisions based on various flags and conditions. The code can be further extended and customized to meet the specific requirements of individual trading strategies.",

It shows the interaction between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` object.\n\n1. The user adds trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations to the `BlackBoxTradingSystem`.\n2. The user calls `enter_trade()` to initiate a trade.\n3. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` loops over the trade triggers and checks if any conditions are met for the primary time frame (1m). If a condition is met, the system enters the trade and checks the 15m confirmation if the 15m chart is active.\n4. If the 15m confirmation is met, the system notifies the user. If it's not met, the system informs the user that the 15m confirmation is not met.\n5. If no trade trigger conditions are met, the system notifies the user that no trade trigger conditions are met.\n6. The user calls `exit_trade()` to initiate a trade exit.\n7. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` loops over the exit rules and checks if any conditions are met for the primary time frame (1m). If a condition is met, the system exits the trade.\n8. If no exit rule conditions are met, the system notifies the user that no exit rule conditions are met.\n9. The user calls `update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")` to update the primary time frame to 1h.\n10. The user calls `enter_trade()` again to initiate a trade based on the updated primary time frame (1h).\n11. The system checks the trade triggers and confirmations for the primary time frame (1h) and the 15m confirmation if the 15m chart is active.\n\nThis sequence diagram helps visualize the control flow of the code and clarifies the steps involved in entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and conditions.\n\nHere's an example scenario with mocked log output of the code:\n\n```python\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\n# Adding trade triggers\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\n# Adding exit rules\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\n# Adding confirmations\nbbts.add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\n\n# Entering and exiting trades\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart\nbbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart\n\n# Updating primary time frame\nbbts.update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart\nbbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1h chart\n\n# Activating and disabling 15m chart\nbbts.activate_15m_chart()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nbbts.disable_15m_chart()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\n# Setting and clearing weekly start flag\nbbts.set_weekly_start_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nbbts.clear_weekly_start_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\n# Setting and clearing trading range flag\nbbts.set_trading_range_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nbbts.clear_trading_range_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\n# Setting and clearing losing trade flag\nbbts.set_losing_trade_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nbbts.clear_losing_trade_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\n# Setting and clearing RSI exit flag\nbbts.set_rsi_exit_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nbbts.clear_rsi_exit_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\n# Setting and clearing acceleration phase flag\nbbts.set_acceleration_phase_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nbbts.clear_acceleration_phase_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\n# Setting and clearing histogram exit modifications\nbbts.set_histogram_exit_modifications()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nbbts.clear_histogram_exit_modifications()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n```\n\nMocked log output:\n```\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nExit trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1h chart\nExit trade based on 1h chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n15m confirmation met\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n15m confirmation met\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n```\n\nExplanation of the hypothetical scenarios mocked:\n\n1. We add trade triggers for the 5m chart and the 1h chart. The trade trigger for the 1h chart requires momentum reflected through the histogram and RSIma.\n2. We add exit rules for the 5m chart and the 1h chart. The exit rule for the 5m chart ensures that the exit would not result in less than a 10p profit. The exit rule for the 1h chart is based on the presence of another 1h exit.\n3. We add a confirmation for the 15m chart, requiring the RSIma to cross 0 in favor of the trade.\n4. We enter and exit trades based on the primary time frame of 1m.\n5. We update the primary time frame to 1h and enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart.\n6. We activate the 15m chart and enter trades based on the 1m chart, checking for the 15m confirmation.\n7. We disable the 15m chart and enter trades based on the 1m chart, without checking the 15m confirmation.\n8. We set and clear the weekly start flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.\n9. We set and clear the trading range flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.\n10. We set and clear the losing trade flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.\n11. We set and clear the RSI exit flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.\n12. We set and clear the acceleration phase flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.\n13. We set and clear the histogram exit modifications, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.\n\nPotential use cases of the code:\n\nThe `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class can be used as a framework for implementing and testing trading strategies. Traders can define their trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations based on their preferred time frames and indicators. By using this class, they can easily manage and modify their trading logic without having to handle the low-level details of the trading system.

The corresponding `set_` and `clear_` methods are included to set and clear the states of these flags.\n\nIn the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, and Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.\n\nThis class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Trader\n    participant BlackBoxTradingSystem\n\n    Note over Trader, BlackBoxTradingSystem: Initialization\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: Create instance\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: Instance created\n\n    Note over Trader, BlackBoxTradingSystem: Adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", condition_5m)\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", condition_1h)\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: add_exit_rule(\"5m\", condition_exit_5m)\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: add_exit_rule(\"1h\", condition_exit_1h)\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: add_confirmation(\"15m\", condition_confirmation)\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: Triggers, rules, and confirmations added\n\n    Note over Trader, BlackBoxTradingSystem: Entering and exiting trades\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: enter_trade()\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: Check trade triggers\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: Check exit rules\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: Enter trade based on chart\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: exit_trade()\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: Check exit rules\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: Exit trade based on chart\n\n    Note over Trader, BlackBoxTradingSystem: Updating primary time frame\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: Primary time frame updated\n\n    Note over Trader, BlackBoxTradingSystem: Activating and disabling 15m chart\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: activate_15m_chart()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: disable_15m_chart()\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: 15m chart activated / disabled\n\n    Note over Trader, BlackBoxTradingSystem: Setting and clearing flags\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_weekly_start_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_weekly_start_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_trading_range_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_trading_range_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_losing_trade_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_losing_trade_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_rsi_exit_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_rsi_exit_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_acceleration_phase_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_acceleration_phase_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_histogram_exit_modifications()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_histogram_exit_modifications()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_capture_best_exits_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_capture_best_exits_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: set_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: clear_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: Flags set / cleared\n\n    Note over Trader, BlackBoxTradingSystem: Example usage of the BlackBoxTradingSystem class\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: enter_trade()\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: Check trade triggers\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: Check exit rules\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: Enter trade based on chart\n    Trader->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: exit_trade()\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem->>BlackBoxTradingSystem: Check exit rules\n    BlackBoxTradingSystem-->>Trader: Exit trade based on chart\n```\n\nThe mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interactions between the trader and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance, including the initialization, adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations, entering and exiting trades, updating the primary time frame, activating and disabling the 15m chart, and setting and clearing flags. The diagram also highlights an example usage of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, demonstrating the steps of entering and exiting trades. This diagram helps to visualize the flow of control between the trader and the trading system and provides a clear understanding of how the different methods and attributes of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class are utilized.\n\nTo demonstrate an example scenario, let's consider the following hypothetical scenarios:\n\n1. Activate 15m Chart and Capture Best Exits:\n- We activate the 15m chart in the black box trading system to analyze trades.\n- We set the capture_best_exits_flag to capture the best exits.\n- In this scenario, a trade trigger condition is met on the 1m chart, and the 15m confirmation is checked.\n- The trade is entered based on the 1m chart, and the 15m confirmation is met.\n- The system logs: \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\" and \"15m confirmation met.\"\n\nExample log output:\n```\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\n15m confirmation met\n```\n\n2. Update Primary Time Frame and Disable 15m Chart:\n- We update the primary time frame to 1h in the black box trading system.\n- We disable the 15m chart.\n- In this scenario, a trade trigger condition is met on the 1h chart.\n- The trade is entered based on the 1h chart.\n- The system logs: \"Enter trade based on 1h chart.\"\n\nExample log output:\n```\nEnter trade based on 1h chart\n```\n\n3. Set Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag:\n- We set the candlestick_suspend_trading_flag in the black box trading system.\n- In this scenario, a trade trigger condition is met on the 1m chart, but the candlestick pattern indicates a potential reversal.\n- The system logs: \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\" but does not proceed with the trade due to the Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag.\n\nExample log output:\n```\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\n```\n\nPotential Use Cases:\nThe code generated provides a flexible framework for implementing a black box trading system. It allows you to define trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations based on different time frames. The system can be used for various trading strategies and can handle advanced concepts such as histogram exit modifications, capturing best exits, exceptions to Flag 9, and the Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag.\n\nSome potential use cases of the code include:\n- Building an automated trading bot that follows a specific trading strategy.\n- Backtesting different trading strategies using historical data.\n- Developing a real-time trading system that analyzes market conditions and executes trades accordingly.\n- Implementing custom trading rules and conditions based on individual preferences and market observations.\n\nWith this framework, traders can have more control over their trading decisions, incorporate advanced exit rules and exceptions, and adapt the system to different market conditions and time frames.",

The corresponding `set_` and `clear_` methods are included to set and clear the states of these flags.\n\nIn the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, and Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.\n\nThis class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n

flow of the code in the previous message. It shows the interaction between the `Trader` and `BlackBoxTradingSystem` objects.\n\n1. The `Trader` adds trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations to the `BlackBoxTradingSystem`.\n2. The `Trader` enters a trade by calling the `enter_trade()` method.\n3. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` checks the trade triggers and exit rules based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m).\n4. If the trade triggers are met, the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` enters the trade based on the primary time frame.\n5. If the 15m chart is active, the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` checks the 15m confirmation.\n6. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` exits the trade based on the primary time frame if the exit rules are met.\n7. The `Trader` can update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15m chart, set or clear various flags (e.g., weekly start flag, trading range flag), and modify the system behavior.\n8. The process can be repeated with different parameters and scenarios as required by the `Trader`.\n\nThis sequence diagram demonstrates the flow of the black box trading system and how the `Trader` interacts with it to manage trades based on different conditions and scenarios.\n\nSure! Here's an example scenario with mocked log output for the code:\n\n```python\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\nbbts.add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\nbbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart\n# Output: Exit trade based on 1m chart\n\nbbts.update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1h chart\n# Output: 15m confirmation met\n\nbbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1h chart\n# Output: Exit trade based on 1h chart\n\nbbts.activate_15m_chart()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n# Output: 15m confirmation met\n\nbbts.disable_15m_chart()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\nbbts.set_weekly_start_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n# Output: 15m confirmation met\n\nbbts.clear_weekly_start_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\n# ... continue with the other scenarios\n\n```\n\nIn this example scenario, we go through different scenarios to illustrate the functionality of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class.\n\n1. We set up trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations for different time frames (5m, 1h) using different conditions.\n2. We enter and exit trades based on the primary time frame of 1m, and we see the corresponding log output.\n3. We update the primary time frame to 1h and see how entering and exiting trades are now based on the 1h chart instead.\n4. We activate the 15m chart, and when entering a trade based on the 1m chart, we also check for the 15m confirmation. The log output indicates that both actions are taken.\n5. We disable the 15m chart and enter a trade based on the 1m chart without checking the 15m confirmation. The log output shows that only the trade based on the 1m chart is taken.\n6. We set and clear the weekly start flag, and observe how it affects the entry of trades and checking of the 15m confirmation.\n\nThe mocked log output provides a visual representation of the actions taken by the black box trading system in response to different conditions and scenarios. It helps to understand how the code and system operate in various situations.\n\nThe code generated for the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class provides a flexible framework for implementing a black box trading system. It allows users to define trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations for different time frames and conditions. The class can be customized to fit specific trading strategies and rules. Some potential use cases for this code include backtesting trading strategies, creating trading bots, and implementing algorithmic trading systems. It provides a modular and extensible structure for handling trade execution and decision-making based on various market signals and indicators.",

The corresponding `set_` and `clear_` methods are included to set and clear the state of the flag.\n\nIn the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.\n\nThis class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant System\n    \n    Note over User: Setup and configuration\n    User->>+System: Create BlackBoxTradingSystem instance\n    \n    Note over User: Add trade triggers\n    User->>+System: add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", condition_5m)\n    User->>+System: add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", condition_1h)\n    \n    Note over User: Add exit rules\n    User->>+System: add_exit_rule(\"5m\", condition_5m_exit)\n    User->>+System: add_exit_rule(\"1h\", condition_1h_exit)\n    \n    Note over User: Add confirmations\n    User->>+System: add_confirmation(\"15m\", condition_15m)\n    \n    Note over User: Trading process\n    User->>+System: enter_trade()\n    System-->>-User: Check trade triggers\n    User->>+System: check_15m_confirmation()\n    System-->>-User: Check 15m confirmation\n    \n    Note over User: Update time frame\n    User->>+System: update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\n    \n    Note over User: Activate 15m chart\n    User->>+System: activate_15m_chart()\n    \n    Note over User: Disable 15m chart\n    User->>+System: disable_15m_chart()\n    \n    Note over User: Set weekly start flag\n    User->>+System: set_weekly_start_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear weekly start flag\n    User->>+System: clear_weekly_start_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Set trading range flag\n    User->>+System: set_trading_range_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear trading range flag\n    User->>+System: clear_trading_range_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Set losing trade flag\n    User->>+System: set_losing_trade_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear losing trade flag\n    User->>+System: clear_losing_trade_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Set RSI exit flag\n    User->>+System: set_rsi_exit_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear RSI exit flag\n    User->>+System: clear_rsi_exit_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Set acceleration phase flag\n    User->>+System: set_acceleration_phase_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear acceleration phase flag\n    User->>+System: clear_acceleration_phase_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Set histogram exit modifications\n    User->>+System: set_histogram_exit_modifications()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear histogram exit modifications\n    User->>+System: clear_histogram_exit_modifications()\n    \n    Note over User: Set capture best exits flag\n    User->>+System: set_capture_best_exits_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear capture best exits flag\n    User->>+System: clear_capture_best_exits_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Set exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud\n    User->>+System: set_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud\n    User->>+System: clear_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()\n    \n    Note over User: Set exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI\n    User->>+System: set_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI\n    User->>+System: clear_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()\n    \n    Note over User: Set Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag\n    User->>+System: set_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag\n    User->>+System: clear_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Set Ignore 5m Exits Flag\n    User->>+System: set_ignore_5m_exits_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Clear Ignore 5m Exits Flag\n    User->>+System: clear_ignore_5m_exits_flag()\n    \n    Note over User: Exiting trades\n    User->>+System: exit_trade()\n    System-->>-User: Check exit rules\n    \n    Note over User: Repeat trading process\n    User->>+System: enter_trade()\n    System-->>-User: Check trade triggers\n    \n    Note over System: Repeat trading process based on user interaction\n```\n\nThe sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interactions between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance. The user sets up the system by adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. Then, the user initiates the trading process by calling the `enter_trade()` method. The system checks the trade triggers and, if the 15m chart is active, verifies the 15m confirmation. The user can update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15m chart, and set or clear various flags that affect the trading behavior. The user can also initiate the exit process by calling the `exit_trade()` method, which checks the exit rules. The trading process can be repeated based on user interaction.\n\nThis sequence diagram provides a clear overview of the control flow and interactions in the black box trading system. It visualizes the steps involved in setting up the system, performing trades, and adjusting the trading behavior based on different conditions and flags.\n\nHere's an example scenario with mocked log output of the code:\n\n```python\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart\n\nbbts.update_primary_time_frame(\"1h\")\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart\n\nbbts.activate_15m_chart()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.disable_15m_chart()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_weekly_start_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_weekly_start_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_trading_range_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_trading_range_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_losing_trade_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_losing_trade_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_rsi_exit_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_rsi_exit_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_acceleration_phase_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_acceleration_phase_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_histogram_exit_modifications()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_histogram_exit_modifications()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_capture_best_exits_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_capture_best_exits_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n\nbbts.set_ignore_5m_exits_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\n\nbbts.clear_ignore_5m_exits_flag()\n\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n```\n\nIn this example scenario, we have a `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance `bbts` with various trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations set up. We then call `enter_trade()` at different stages and observe the mocked log output.\n\nBased on the log output, we can see the trades being entered based on the specified chart that meets the given conditions. For example, when the primary time frame is set to 1m, a trade is entered based on a 1m chart trigger. When the primary time frame is updated to 1h, a trade is entered based on a 1h chart trigger. The log output also shows the effect of activating and disabling the 15m chart, setting and clearing different flags, and checking the 15m confirmation.\n\nPotential use cases for the code include implementing and backtesting trading strategies, building trading systems, and automating trading decisions based on specific conditions and triggers. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class provides a framework to define and manage trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations across different time frames, allowing for flexibility in developing and testing various trading strategies.",

The corresponding `set_` and `clear_` methods are included to set and clear the state of the flag.\n\nIn the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.\n\nThis class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Trader\n    participant BBTS as BlackBoxTradingSystem\n\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Create BlackBoxTradingSystem instance\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Add trade triggers\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Add exit rules\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Add confirmations\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Exit trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Exit trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Update primary time frame\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1h chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Exit trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Exit trade based on 1h chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Activate 15m chart\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"15m confirmation met\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Disable 15m chart\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set weekly start flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"15m confirmation met\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear weekly start flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set trading range flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear trading range flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set losing trade flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear losing trade flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set RSI exit flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear RSI exit flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set acceleration phase flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear acceleration phase flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set histogram exit modifications\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear histogram exit modifications\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set capture best exits flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear capture best exits flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Set Ignore 5m Exits Flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Clear Ignore 5m Exits Flag\n    Trader->>+BBTS: Enter trade\n    BBTS-->>-Trader: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n```\n\nThe sequence diagram represents the flow of control in the code provided. It starts by creating an instance of the BlackBoxTradingSystem class and adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. The trader then enters and exits trades based on the current primary time frame. The sequence diagram includes various steps for activating and disabling the 15m chart, setting and clearing different flags, and entering trades based on the 1m chart with or without checking the 15m confirmation. The diagram shows the interaction between the trader and the BlackBoxTradingSystem class, illustrating the control flow for different scenarios and conditions.\n\nTo illustrate the usage of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we have set up a trading system with specific trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We will simulate the log output of the code to show the flow of entering and exiting trades based on different conditions.\n\n```python\nbbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()\n\n# Adding trade triggers\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\n\n# Adding exit rules\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\n\n# Adding confirmations\nbbts.add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\n\n# Entering and exiting trades\nbbts.enter_trade()  #

Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nbbts.clear_ignore_5m_exits_flag()\nbbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked\n```\n\nHere's the expected log output based on the setup:\n\n```\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nExit trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1h chart\nExit trade based on 1h chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nEnter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\n```\n\nIn this example scenario, we simulate the log output to demonstrate the flows of entering and exiting trades based on different conditions and settings of the black box trading system.\n\nThe hypothetical scenarios we mocked include:\n\n- Entering and exiting trades based on different time frames: We start by entering and exiting trades based on the default primary time frame of 1 minute (1m chart), then update the primary time frame to 1 hour (1h chart) and enter and exit trades accordingly.\n\n- 15-minute chart usage: We activate the 15-minute chart and observe that when the 1-minute chart triggers a trade, we also check for 15-minute confirmation before entering the trade.\n\n- Specific flags and scenarios: We set and clear various flags such as the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications flag, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud flag, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI flag, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag. We observe how these flags affect the trade entry process based on the 1-minute chart.\n\nThe `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class provides a flexible and modular framework to design and execute black box trading strategies. It allows users to define and manage trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations for different time frames. It also provides the ability to set and clear various flags to customize the trading behavior based on specific conditions and scenarios. The class can be used to implement a wide range of trading strategies with different rules and conditions, providing a powerful tool for algorithmic trading.",

to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as additional exit rules and parameters for long-term backtesting.\n\nThe `additional_exit_rules` attribute is added to store the additional exit rules. The `add_additional_exit_rule` method is included to add new exit rules to the system.\n\nIn the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations as before. We also add additional exit rules based on the shooting star and hammer patterns. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m) and check if the additional exit rules are met. After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart and evaluate the additional exit rules. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.\n\nThis class provides a comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames, additional exit rules, and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant TradingSystem\n\n    User -> TradingSystem: Add trade triggers\n    User -> TradingSystem: Add exit rules\n    User -> TradingSystem: Add confirmations\n    User -> TradingSystem: Add additional exit rules\n    User -> TradingSystem: Set flags and parameters\n    User -> TradingSystem: Enter trade\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    loop Check 15m chart confirmation\n        TradingSystem -> TradingSystem: Check 15m confirmation\n    end\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"15m confirmation met\"\n    User -> TradingSystem: Exit trade\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"Exit trade based on 1m chart\"\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"Additional exit rule met\"\n    \n    loop Update primary time frame\n        User -> TradingSystem: Update primary time frame\n    end\n\n    User -> TradingSystem: Enter trade\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"Enter trade based on 1h chart\"\n    loop Check 15m chart confirmation\n        TradingSystem -> TradingSystem: Check 15m confirmation\n    end\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"15m confirmation met\"\n    User -> TradingSystem: Exit trade\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"Exit trade based on 1h chart\"\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"Additional exit rule met\"\n\n    loop Activate/Disable 15m chart\n        User -> TradingSystem: Activate/Disable 15m chart\n    end\n\n    User -> TradingSystem: Set/Clear flags and parameters\n    User -> TradingSystem: Enter trade\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"15m confirmation not checked\"\n\n    loop Set/Clear flags and parameters\n        User -> TradingSystem: Set/Clear flags and parameters\n    end\n\n    User -> TradingSystem: Enter trade\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"Enter trade based on 1m chart\"\n    TradingSystem ->> User: Print \"15m confirmation not checked\"\n\n    ... Additional steps and interactions ...\n\n```\n\nThe sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interactions between the user and the `TradingSystem` object, including adding trade triggers, exit rules, confirmations, additional exit rules, and setting flags and parameters. It then depicts the sequence of entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and conditions.\n\nThe diagram highlights the loops for checking the 15m chart confirmation, updating the primary time frame, and activating/disabling the 15m chart. It also shows the steps for entering trades, printing messages based on the trade triggers and confirmations, exiting trades, and printing additional exit rule met.\n\nThe diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow, showcasing the interactions between the user and the trading system and the logical sequence of steps involved in executing trades and evaluating conditions.\n\nI'll provide an example scenario with mocked log output for the code:\n\n```python\nbbts.activate_15m_chart()\nbbts.set_capture_best_exits_flag()\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"5m\", \"prices close across 5m 13ema\")\nbbts.add_trade_trigger(\"1h\", \"momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"5m\", \"5m exit would result in < 10p profit\")\nbbts.add_exit_rule(\"1h\", \"another 1h exit presents itself\")\nbbts.add_confirmation(\"15m\", \"15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade\")\nbbts.add_additional_exit_rule(\"shooting star high is the highest high for 8 bars\")\nbbts.add_additional_exit_rule(\"hammer low is the lowest low for 8 bars\")\nbbts.add_additional_exit_rule(\"raw RSI > 70 for shooting star exit\")\nbbts.add_additional_exit_rule(\"raw RSI < 30 for hammer exit\")\n\nbbts.enter_trade()\nbbts.exit_trade()\n```\n\nMocked log output:\n```\nEnter trade based on 1m chart\nExit trade based on 1m chart\nAdditional exit rule met\n```\n\nThe hypothetical scenario we mocked involves activating the 15m chart and enabling capturing the best exits. We added trade triggers for the 5m and 1h charts, exit rules for the 5m and 1h charts, and a confirmation for the 15m chart. Additionally, we included additional exit rules for the shooting star and hammer patterns.\n\nIn this scenario, the system enters a trade based on the trade triggers on the 1m chart. It then exits the trade based on the exit rules on the 1m chart. Since we added additional exit rules for the shooting star and hammer patterns, the system also checks if these conditions are met and finds that the additional exit rule has been met.\n\nThis example demonstrates the flexibility of the code to incorporate different time frames, additional exit rules, and trade confirmations. The code can be used to build and test advanced trading strategies that utilize multiple charts, additional exit conditions, and other parameters to optimize trade decisions. It provides a framework for systematically defining and implementing complex trading rules and conditions."
