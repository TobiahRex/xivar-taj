The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` represents a simplified implementation of the black box trading system. It has methods to add trade triggers and exit rules for different time frames (e.g., 5m, 1h) and to enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame. The `update_primary_time_frame` method allows changing the primary time frame.

In the example usage, we create an instance of `BlackBoxTradingSystem` and add trade triggers and exit rules for the 5m and 1h charts. Then, we enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart.

This class provides a simplified implementation to demonstrate the concept of the black box trading system and can be expanded upon to include additional functionality and conditions based on the specific requirements of the system.

The mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. The diagram shows the interactions between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class.

1. The user adds trade triggers and exit rules using the `add_trade_trigger` and `add_exit_rule` methods.
2. The user calls the `enter_trade` method, which triggers the system to check the trade triggers.
3. The system checks the trade triggers based on the primary time frame (initially set to 1m) and notifies the user about entering a trade based on the 1m chart.
4. The user calls the `exit_trade` method, which triggers the system to check the exit rules.
5. The system checks the exit rules based on the primary time frame (1m) and notifies the user about exiting the trade based on the 1m chart.
6. The user calls the `update_primary_time_frame` method to change the primary time frame to 1h.
7. The user then calls the `enter_trade` method again, which triggers the system to check the trade triggers based on the updated primary time frame (1h).
8. The system notifies the user about entering a trade based on the 1h chart.
9. Finally, the user calls the `exit_trade` method again, which triggers the system to check the exit rules based on the primary time frame (1h). The system notifies the user about exiting the trade based on the 1h chart.

The sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow and communication between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class.

Example scenario:

```python
bbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()

# Adding trade triggers
bbts.add_trade_trigger("5m", "prices close across 5m 13ema")
bbts.add_trade_trigger("1h", "momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma")

# Adding exit rules
bbts.add_exit_rule("5m", "5m exit would result in < 10p profit")
bbts.add_exit_rule("1h", "another 1h exit presents itself")

# Entering and exiting trades
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart
bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart

bbts.update_primary_time_frame("1h")
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart
bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1h chart
```

Mocked log output:

```
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Exit trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1h chart
Exit trade based on 1h chart
```

Hypothetical scenarios explained:

In the example scenario, we create an instance of `BlackBoxTradingSystem` and add trade triggers and exit rules for the 5m and 1h charts. The trade triggers and exit rules are simplified for illustration purposes. In a real-world scenario, these conditions would be more detailed and based on specific technical analysis indicators.

In this case, the trade trigger for the 1m chart is to enter a trade when certain conditions are met. However, since we have not provided the specific conditions in the example, we assume that the conditions are met in this scenario, causing the log message "Enter trade based on 1m chart" to be printed.

Similarly, the exit rule for the 1m chart is triggered in this scenario, causing the log message "Exit trade based on 1m chart" to be printed.

After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we repeat the process for the 1h chart. Again, the specific conditions for the trade trigger and exit rule are not provided, so we assume they are met in this scenario, resulting in the log messages "Enter trade based on 1h chart" and "Exit trade based on 1h chart" being printed.

Potential use cases:

The code generated provides a foundation for building a black box trading system. It can be used in various scenarios where automated trading based on technical analysis indicators is desired. Here are a few potential use cases:

1. Algorithmic trading: The code can serve as a starting point for implementing an algorithmic trading strategy that automatically enters and exits trades based on predefined conditions. Traders can customize the trade triggers and exit rules according to their specific strategies.

2. Backtesting: Traders can use the code to backtest their trading strategies on historical data. By simulating trades and analyzing the outcomes, they can evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies and make necessary adjustments.

3. Trading signal generation: The code can be used to generate trading signals that can be integrated into other trading systems or platforms. By implementing the trade triggers and exit rules, the code can generate signals based on the specified conditions, which can then be used to trigger trades in real-time trading systems.

Overall, the code provides a flexible and customizable framework for implementing a black box trading system, allowing traders to automate their trading strategies and make data-driven trading decisions.
## Details
The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` represents a simplified implementation of the black box trading system. It has methods to add trade triggers and exit rules for different time frames (e.g., 5m, 1h) and to enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame. The `update_primary_time_frame` method allows changing the primary time frame.

In the example usage, we create an instance of `BlackBoxTradingSystem` and add trade triggers and exit rules for the 5m and 1h charts. Then, we enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart.

This class provides a simplified implementation to demonstrate the concept of the black box trading system and can be expanded upon to include additional functionality and conditions based on the specific requirements of the system.

The expanded version of the code adds detailed logic and explanations for each method:

```python
class BlackBoxTradingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary_time_frame = "1m"
        self.trade_triggers = []
        self.exit_rules = []
    
    def add_trade_trigger(self, chart, condition):
        """
        Add a trade trigger for a specific chart and condition.
        
        :param chart: str, the time frame chart (e.g., "5m", "1h")
        :param condition: str, the condition for entering a trade
        """
        self.trade_triggers.append((chart, condition))
    
    def add_exit_rule(self, chart, condition):
        """
        Add an exit rule for a specific chart and condition.
        
        :param chart: str, the time frame chart (e.g., "5m", "1h")
        :param condition: str, the condition for exiting a trade
        """
        self.exit_rules.append((chart, condition))
    
    def enter_trade(self):
        """
        Check all trade triggers for the primary time frame and enter a trade if conditions are met.
        """
        for chart, condition in self.trade_triggers:
            if chart == self.primary_time_frame and condition:
                print("Enter trade based on", chart, "chart")
    
    def exit_trade(self):
        """
        Check all exit rules for the primary time frame and exit a trade if conditions are met.
        """
        for chart, condition in self.exit_rules:
            if chart == self.primary_time_frame and condition:
                print("Exit trade based on", chart, "chart")
    
    def update_primary_time_frame(self, time_frame):
        """
        Update the primary time frame.
        
        :param time_frame: str, the new primary time frame
        """
        self.primary_time_frame = time_frame
```

The logic for each method is as follows:

- The `__init__` method initializes the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance with default values for the primary time frame, trade triggers, and exit rules.

- The `add_trade_trigger` method adds a trade trigger for a specific time frame chart and condition. It appends a tuple `(chart, condition)` to the `trade_triggers` list.

- The `add_exit_rule` method adds an exit rule for a specific time frame chart and condition. It appends a tuple `(chart, condition)` to the `exit_rules` list.

- The `enter_trade` method iterates over all trade triggers and checks if the chart is the same as the primary time frame. If it is, and the condition is met, it prints a message indicating that a trade should be entered based on the specified chart.

- The `exit_trade` method iterates over all exit rules and checks if the chart is the same as the primary time frame. If it is, and the condition is met, it prints a message indicating that a trade should be exited based on the specified chart.

- The `update_primary_time_frame` method updates the primary time frame to the specified value.

The expanded code provides a more detailed implementation of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, including explanations for each method.

        self.is_15m_chart_active = True
    
    def disable_15m_chart(self):
        self.is_15m_chart_active = False

# Example usage
bbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()

# Adding trade triggers
bbts.add_trade_trigger("5m", "prices close across 5m 13ema")
bbts.add_trade_trigger("1h", "momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma")

# Adding exit rules
bbts.add_exit_rule("5m", "5m exit would result in < 10p profit")
bbts.add_exit_rule("1h", "another 1h exit presents itself")

# Adding confirmations
bbts.add_confirmation("15m", "15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade")

# Entering and exiting trades
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart
bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart

# Updating primary time frame
bbts.update_primary_time_frame("1h")
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart
bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1h chart

# Activating and disabling 15m chart
bbts.activate_15m_chart()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.disable_15m_chart()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked
```

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as confirmations and the usage of the 15m chart. 

The `confirmations` attribute is added to store the confirmation conditions for different charts. The `add_confirmation` method allows adding confirmation conditions.

The `check_15m_confirmation` method is introduced to check if the 15m confirmation condition is met when entering a trade based on the 1m chart. This method is called within the `enter_trade` method when the 15m chart is active.

The `activate_15m_chart` and `disable_15m_chart` methods are included to control the activation and deactivation of the 15m chart.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. Finally, we activate the 15m chart, enter a trade based on the 1m chart, and check the 15m confirmation. We then disable the 15m chart and enter another trade based on the 1m chart, but the 15m confirmation is not checked.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and confirmation conditions.

Example Scenario:
```
bbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()

# Adding trade triggers
bbts.add_trade_trigger("5m", "prices close across 5m 13ema")
bbts.add_trade_trigger("1h", "momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma")

# Adding exit rules
bbts.add_exit_rule("5m", "5m exit would result in < 10p profit")
bbts.add_exit_rule("1h", "another 1h exit presents itself")

# Adding confirmations
bbts.add_confirmation("15m", "15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade")

# Activating and disabling 15m chart
bbts.activate_15m_chart()

# Scenario 1: Trade entry based on 1m chart
bbts.enter_trade()
# Output: "Enter trade based on 1m chart"
# Output: "15m confirmation met"

# Scenario 2: Trade exit based on 1m chart
bbts.exit_trade()
# Output: "Exit trade based on 1m chart"

# Scenario 3: Trade entry based on 1h chart
bbts.update_primary_time_frame("1h")
bbts.enter_trade()
# Output: "Enter trade based on 1h chart"

# Scenario 4: Trade exit based on 1h chart
bbts.exit_trade()
# Output: "Exit trade based on 1h chart"

bbts.disable_15m_chart()

# Scenario 5: Trade entry based on 1m chart without 15m confirmation
bbts.enter_trade()
# Output: "Enter trade based on 1m chart"
```

Explanation of Mocked Scenarios:
1. In the first scenario, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We activate the 15m chart. Then, we enter a trade based on the 1m chart, which triggers the trade entry and the 15m confirmation, indicating that the conditions are met for the trade.
2. In the second scenario, we exit the trade based on the 1m chart, which triggers the trade exit.
3. In the third scenario, we update the primary time frame to 1h. Then, we enter a trade based on the 1h chart, triggering the trade entry.
4. In the fourth scenario, we exit the trade based on the 1h chart, triggering the trade exit.
5. In the fifth scenario, we disable the 15m chart. Then, we enter a trade based on the 1m chart without checking the 15m confirmation since the 15m chart is disabled.

Potential Use Cases:
- The code can be used in algorithmic trading systems where traders rely on automated decisions based on specific chart conditions and trade triggers.
- It can be adapted as a framework for backtesting trading strategies, allowing traders to evaluate the past performance of various trade triggers and exit rules.
- The code can serve as a starting point for building more complex trading systems, incorporating additional indicators, risk management rules, or machine learning algorithms.
- Traders can use the code as a reference to understand and implement their own trading systems, tailoring the conditions and rules to their specific strategies and preferences.

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as the weekly start flag and the trading range flag.

The `weekly_start_flag` and `trading_range_flag` attributes are added to keep track of the flags' state. The `set_weekly_start_flag`, `clear_weekly_start_flag`, `set_trading_range_flag`, and `clear_trading_range_flag` methods are included to set and clear the flags' state.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. Lastly, we set and clear the weekly start flag and the trading range flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet, such as the weekly start flag and the trading range flag. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and flags' state.

The mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interactions between the trader and the BlackBoxTradingSystem object, as well as the TradeTriggersList, ExitRulesList, and ConfirmationsList objects.

The steps in the control flow are labeled and numbered to indicate the sequence of events. The diagram begins with the trader creating a BlackBoxTradingSystem object and adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. The trader then interacts with the BlackBoxTradingSystem object to enter and exit trades, update the primary time frame, and activate or disable the 15m chart. The trader is also able to set or clear the weekly start flag and the trading range flag.

The TradeTriggersList, ExitRulesList, and ConfirmationsList objects are called upon by the BlackBoxTradingSystem object to retrieve the conditions for trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations, respectively.

The diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow and interactions within the code, highlighting the steps involved in the black box trading system.

Example Scenario:

```python
bbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()

# Adding trade triggers
bbts.add_trade_trigger("5m", "prices close across 5m 13ema")
bbts.add_trade_trigger("1h", "momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma")

# Adding exit rules
bbts.add_exit_rule("5m", "5m exit would result in < 10p profit")
bbts.add_exit_rule("1h", "another 1h exit presents itself")

# Adding confirmations
bbts.add_confirmation("15m", "15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade")

# Activating 15m chart
bbts.activate_15m_chart()

# Setting weekly start flag
bbts.set_weekly_start_flag()

# Entering trade based on 1m chart (weekly start flag set)
bbts.enter_trade()
```

Mocked Log Output:
```
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
15m confirmation met
```

Hypothetical Scenario:
In this scenario, we have a `BlackBoxTradingSystem` object initialized with trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We activate the 15m chart and set the weekly start flag. Then, we enter a trade based on the 1m chart.

Explanation:
The log output shows that the trade was entered based on the 1m chart. Since the weekly start flag was set, the system checks the 15m confirmation before entering the trade. In this case, the 15m confirmation condition was met, and the trade was executed accordingly.

Potential Use Cases:
1. Algorithmic Trading: The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class can be used as a foundation for developing algorithmic trading strategies. Triggers and rules can be customized for specific trading algorithms and strategies.
2. Backtesting: The class can be used to backtest trading strategies by feeding historical data and evaluating how the system would have performed in the past.
3. Risk Management: By defining specific exit rules and profit targets, the system can help manage and automate risk management processes in trading.
4. Strategy Development: Traders and analysts can use the class to experiment with different trade triggers, exit rules, and time frames to develop and refine new trading strategies.
5. Real-time Trading: The class can be integrated with live market data feeds to facilitate real-time trading decisions and execution based on predefined triggers and rules.

Overall, the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` provides a versatile framework for designing, testing, and implementing various trading strategies and can be adapted to meet specific trading requirements and objectives.

The expanded code provides a more detailed implementation of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class. The class has methods to add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations to the respective lists. It also has methods to enter and exit trades based on the primary time frame, check the 15m confirmation if the 15m chart is active, update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15m chart, and set or clear the weekly start flag and the trading range flag.

In the example usage, trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations are added to the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` object. Trades are then entered and exited based on the current primary time frame. The primary time frame is updated to 1h, and trades are entered and exited based on the new time frame. The 15m chart is activated, and trades are entered based on the primary time frame with and without checking the 15m confirmation. The weekly start flag is set, and trades are entered with and without checking the 15m confirmation. The weekly start flag is then cleared, and trades are entered with and without checking the 15m confirmation. The trading range flag is set and cleared, and trades are entered with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

The expanded code provides a more detailed and comprehensive implementation of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, incorporating the additional functionality mentioned in the code snippet.

    User -> bbts: clear_trading_range_flag()
    User -> bbts: enter_trade()
    bbts -> User: Enter trade based on 1m chart
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code. It starts with the user adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. Then, the user updates the primary time frame to 1h, activates the 15m chart, sets the weekly start flag, and enters a trade.

The black box trading system (`bbts`) checks if the 15m chart is active and if so, confirms the trade based on the 15m chart. Then, the system exits the trade based on the 1m chart, disables the 15m chart, clears the weekly start flag, and sets the trading range flag. The system enters another trade based on the 1m chart and clears the trading range flag.

This diagram helps visualize the sequence of steps involved in using the black box trading system and how the control flow progresses based on the different conditions and actions performed by the user.

Example scenario:

```python
bbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()

No trading signals in any timeframe due to the weekly start flag
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

```

Explanation:

In this scenario, we have a `BlackBoxTradingSystem` object `bbts` with added trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We start by setting the weekly start flag using the `set_weekly_start_flag()` method. When attempting to enter trades using the `enter_trade()` method, no trading signals are generated in any timeframe due to the weekly start flag being set.

We then clear the weekly start flag using the `clear_weekly_start_flag()` method. Next, we activate the 15m chart using the `activate_15m_chart()` method. When attempting to enter trades again using the `enter_trade()` method, a trade is entered based on the 1m chart and the 15m confirmation is checked.

Subsequently, we exit the trade using the `exit_trade()` method based on the 1m chart. We then disable the 15m chart using the `disable_15m_chart()` method. Next, we set the trading range flag using the `set_trading_range_flag()` method.

When attempting to enter trades once more using the `enter_trade()` method, a trade is entered based on the 1m chart and the 15m confirmation is checked. However, this time the trading range flag is set, so special rules apply. Finally, we clear the trading range flag using the `clear_trading_range_flag()` method and enter another trade based on the 1m chart.

The log output shows that trades are entered and exited based on the specified conditions and flags.

Potential use cases:

The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class can be used to implement and automate a black box trading system. Traders can define the trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations based on their specific trading strategies. The system can be easily customized to adapt to different time frames and market conditions.

Some potential use cases for this code include:

1. Algorithmic Trading: Implementing a black box trading system in an algorithmic trading strategy can help make automated trading decisions based on predefined rules, triggers, and confirmations.

2. Technical Analysis: Traders can use the code to backtest and analyze trading strategies based on different time frames, indicators, and exit rules.

3. Risk Management: The code can be integrated into risk management systems to automatically enter and exit trades based on risk parameters and predefined rules.

Overall, the code provides a framework for building and testing black box trading systems and can be a valuable tool for traders looking to implement systematic and rule-based trading strategies.

```
The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class is expanded to include more detailed logic and comments. The class now has methods to add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. The trading system enters and exits trades based on the primary time frame, and optionally checks for 15-minute chart confirmations if the 15-minute chart is active.

The primary time frame can be updated using the `update_primary_time_frame` method. The 15-minute chart can be activated or disabled using the `activate_15m_chart` and `disable_15m_chart` methods, respectively. The weekly start flag and trading range flag can be set using the `set_weekly_start_flag` and `set_trading_range_flag` methods, and cleared using the `clear_weekly_start_flag` and `clear_trading_range_flag` methods, respectively.

The example usage demonstrates how to add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations to the trading system. It then shows how to enter and exit trades based on different time frames, activate or disable the 15-minute chart, and set or clear the weekly start flag and trading range flag.

The expanded code provides a more detailed and commented implementation of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and flags' state.

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as the losing trade flag and the RSI exit flag.

The `losing_trade_flag` and `rsi_exit_flag` attributes are added to keep track of the flags' state. The `set_losing_trade_flag`, `clear_losing_trade_flag`, `set_rsi_exit_flag`, and `clear_rsi_exit_flag` methods are included to set and clear the flags' state.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, and RSI exit flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet, such as the losing trade flag and the RSI exit flag. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and flags' state.

The mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message, showcasing the interaction between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance (`bbts`).

The diagram shows the steps taken by the user to add trade triggers, exit rules, confirmations, and set various flags. The user can also update the primary time frame and activate or disable the 15m chart. Additionally, the user can enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame, with the conditions being checked within the `BlackBoxTradingSystem`. The diagram demonstrates the flow of information and control between the user and the trading system.

The sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow, highlighting the interaction and steps involved in using the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class.

```

In this example scenario, we have created an instance of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class and added trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then simulate entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and conditions.

1. Initial trades: We enter and exit trades based on the 1m chart, which triggers the trade and exit based on the conditions specified for the 1m time frame.

2. Changing time frame: We update the primary time frame to 1h, and then enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart, applying the conditions for the 1h time frame.

3. Activating and disabling 15m chart: We activate the 15m chart and then enter trades based on the 1m chart, with the option to check 15m confirmation. We then disable the 15m chart and enter trades based on the 1m chart without checking the 15m confirmation.

4. Setting and clearing flags: We set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, and RSI exit flag. We then enter trades based on the 1m chart, with or without checking the 15m confirmation, depending on the flag status.

These scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class to handle different time frames, entry and exit rules, and various flags that control the trading behavior. It allows for customizable trading strategies based on the specific conditions and flags set by the user.

The expanded code includes the implementation of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class and an example usage scenario. The class includes methods for adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. It also has methods for entering and exiting trades, checking the 15m confirmation, updating the primary time frame, activating and disabling the 15m chart, and setting and clearing various flags.

The example usage scenario demonstrates the use of the class in different scenarios, such as entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and conditions, updating the primary time frame, activating and disabling the 15m chart, and setting and clearing flags.

The code provides a more detailed logic for the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, allowing for customizable trading strategies based on various conditions, time frames, and flags' states.

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as the acceleration phase flag and the trading week start.

The `acceleration_phase_flag` attribute is added to keep track of the flag's state. The `set_acceleration_phase_flag` and `clear_acceleration_phase_flag` methods are included to set and clear the flag's state.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, and acceleration phase flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet, such as the acceleration phase flag and the trading week start. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and flags' state.

The sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interaction between the `Trader` and `BBTSystem` objects and the steps involved in the trading actions.

1. The `Trader` calls the `enter_trade` method on the `BBTSystem` to enter a trade based on the 1m chart.
2. The `BBTSystem` responds by executing the trade based on the 1m chart and notifies the `Trader` of the action.
3. The `Trader` updates the primary time frame to 1h in the `BBTSystem`.
4. The `Trader` activates the 15m chart in the `BBTSystem`.
5. The `Trader` disables the 15m chart in the `BBTSystem`.
6. The `Trader` sets the weekly start flag in the `BBTSystem`.
7. The `Trader` clears the weekly start flag in the `BBTSystem`.
8. The `Trader` sets the trading range flag in the `BBTSystem`.
9. The `Trader` clears the trading range flag in the `BBTSystem`.
10. The `Trader` sets the losing trade flag in the `BBTSystem`.
11. The `Trader` clears the losing trade flag in the `BBTSystem`.
12. The `Trader` sets the RSI exit flag in the `BBTSystem`.
13. The `Trader` clears the RSI exit flag in the `BBTSystem`.
14. The `Trader` sets the acceleration phase flag in the `BBTSystem`.
15. The `Trader` clears the acceleration phase flag in the `BBTSystem`.

The sequence diagram visually represents the control flow of the code and the interactions between the `Trader` and `BBTSystem` objects for each step. It helps illustrate how the different methods and flags are used in the trading actions.

Sure! Here's an example scenario with mocked log output:

```python
# Creating the BlackBoxTradingSystem instance

```

In this example scenario, we create an instance of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class and configure it with various trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then invoke the `enter_trade()` and `exit_trade()` methods multiple times, based on different time frames, flag states, and conditions.

The mocked log output shows the messages that would be generated when entering and exiting trades based on the defined conditions and flags. For example, when the 15m confirmation is met, the log output displays "15m confirmation met".

The hypothetical scenarios mocked in this example involve entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and flag states. The code demonstrates how the black box trading system handles different scenarios and applies the appropriate rules.

Potential use cases of the code include developing and testing trading strategies using different time frames, incorporating specific triggers and exits, and managing trade decisions based on various flags and conditions. The code can be further extended and customized to meet the specific requirements of individual trading strategies.

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as the histogram exit modifications.

The `histogram_exit_modifications` attribute is added to keep track of the state of the modifications. The `set_histogram_exit_modifications` and `clear_histogram_exit_modifications` methods are included to set and clear the state of the modifications.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, and histogram exit modifications, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet, such as the histogram exit modifications. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the modifications to the histogram exit.

# - Weekly start flag is set
# - Trading range flag is set
# - Losing trade flag is set
# - RSI exit flag is set
# - Acceleration phase flag is set
# - Histogram exit modifications are set
# - 15m chart is active

# Exiting trade
bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart

# Example log output
# Exit trade based on 1m chart

# Potential Scenarios:
# The example scenario depicts a situation where all the flags are set and the trade trigger on the 1m chart is met. This scenario demonstrates the execution of a trade entry based on the 1m chart and the confirmation from the 15m chart. The trade is then exited based on the exit rules specified.

# Use Cases:
# - Backtesting: The code can be used to backtest trading strategies that incorporate the various flags and conditions outlined in the black box trading system. By simulating historical market data, traders can evaluate the performance and profitability of their strategies.
# - Algorithmic Trading: The code can be integrated into an algorithmic trading system to automate trading decisions based on the specified rules and flags. This can help traders execute trades quickly and efficiently in real-time markets.
# - Strategy Development: Traders can use the code as a starting point to develop and refine their own trading strategies. By modifying the trade triggers, exit rules, and other parameters, traders can tailor the system to their preferred trading style and market conditions.
# - Education and Research: The code can be used in educational settings and research environments to study the impact of different trading strategies and flags on the performance of the black box trading system.
## Details
# Detailed logic

The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class represents a black box trading system that allows users to define trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations based on different time frames. The class provides methods to enter and exit trades, update the primary time frame, activate and disable the 15m chart, and set and clear various flags.

## Class Attributes

- `primary_time_frame`: A string representing the primary time frame for trade analysis. Default value is "1m".
- `trade_triggers`: A list of tuples representing trade triggers. Each tuple contains a chart (string) and a condition (string).
- `exit_rules`: A list of tuples representing exit rules. Each tuple contains a chart (string) and a condition (string).
- `confirmations`: A list of tuples representing confirmations. Each tuple contains a chart (string) and a condition (string).
- `is_15m_chart_active`: A boolean flag indicating whether the 15m chart is active. Default value is False.
- `weekly_start_flag`: A boolean flag indicating whether the weekly start flag is set. Default value is False.
- `trading_range_flag`: A boolean flag indicating whether the trading range flag is set. Default value is False.
- `losing_trade_flag`: A boolean flag indicating whether the losing trade flag is set. Default value is False.
- `rsi_exit_flag`: A boolean flag indicating whether the RSI exit flag is set. Default value is False.
- `acceleration_phase_flag`: A boolean flag indicating whether the acceleration phase flag is set. Default value is False.
- `histogram_exit_modifications`: A boolean flag indicating whether the histogram exit modifications are set. Default value is False.

## Methods

- `add_trade_trigger(chart, condition)`: Add a trade trigger to the trade_triggers list. The chart parameter is a string representing the chart time frame, and the condition parameter is a string representing the condition for the trade trigger.
- `add_exit_rule(chart, condition)`: Add an exit rule to the exit_rules list. The chart parameter is a string representing the chart time frame, and the condition parameter is a string representing the condition for the exit rule.
- `add_confirmation(chart, condition)`: Add a confirmation to the confirmations list. The chart parameter is a string representing the chart time frame, and the condition parameter is a string representing the condition for the confirmation.
- `enter_trade()`: Enter a trade based on the trade triggers and check the 15m confirmation if the 15m chart is active.
- `exit_trade()`: Exit a trade based on the exit rules.
- `check_15m_confirmation()`: Check the 15m confirmation based on the confirmations.
- `update_primary_time_frame(time_frame)`: Update the primary time frame with the specified time frame.
- `activate_15m_chart()`: Activate the 15m chart.
- `disable_15m_chart()`: Disable the 15m chart.

The sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interaction between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` object.

1. The user adds trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations to the `BlackBoxTradingSystem`.
2. The user calls `enter_trade()` to initiate a trade.
3. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` loops over the trade triggers and checks if any conditions are met for the primary time frame (1m). If a condition is met, the system enters the trade and checks the 15m confirmation if the 15m chart is active.
4. If the 15m confirmation is met, the system notifies the user. If it's not met, the system informs the user that the 15m confirmation is not met.
5. If no trade trigger conditions are met, the system notifies the user that no trade trigger conditions are met.
6. The user calls `exit_trade()` to initiate a trade exit.
7. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` loops over the exit rules and checks if any conditions are met for the primary time frame (1m). If a condition is met, the system exits the trade.
8. If no exit rule conditions are met, the system notifies the user that no exit rule conditions are met.
9. The user calls `update_primary_time_frame("1h")` to update the primary time frame to 1h.
10. The user calls `enter_trade()` again to initiate a trade based on the updated primary time frame (1h).
11. The system checks the trade triggers and confirmations for the primary time frame (1h) and the 15m confirmation if the 15m chart is active.

This sequence diagram helps visualize the control flow of the code and clarifies the steps involved in entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and conditions.

Explanation of the hypothetical scenarios mocked:

1. We add trade triggers for the 5m chart and the 1h chart. The trade trigger for the 1h chart requires momentum reflected through the histogram and RSIma.
2. We add exit rules for the 5m chart and the 1h chart. The exit rule for the 5m chart ensures that the exit would not result in less than a 10p profit. The exit rule for the 1h chart is based on the presence of another 1h exit.
3. We add a confirmation for the 15m chart, requiring the RSIma to cross 0 in favor of the trade.
4. We enter and exit trades based on the primary time frame of 1m.
5. We update the primary time frame to 1h and enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart.
6. We activate the 15m chart and enter trades based on the 1m chart, checking for the 15m confirmation.
7. We disable the 15m chart and enter trades based on the 1m chart, without checking the 15m confirmation.
8. We set and clear the weekly start flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.
9. We set and clear the trading range flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.
10. We set and clear the losing trade flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.
11. We set and clear the RSI exit flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.
12. We set and clear the acceleration phase flag, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.
13. We set and clear the histogram exit modifications, entering trades based on the 1m chart and checking the 15m confirmation.

Potential use cases of the code:

The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class can be used as a framework for implementing and testing trading strategies. Traders can define their trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations based on their preferred time frames and indicators. By using this class, they can easily manage and modify their trading logic without having to handle the low-level details of the trading system. The class provides flexibility to adapt to different market conditions and allows traders to experiment with various strategies by enabling or disabling different flags and modifications. Additionally, the class can be extended with additional methods and attributes to support more advanced trading strategies and scenarios.
## Details
The expanded code snippet includes the implementation of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class with several additional methods and attributes.

1. The `is_15m_chart_active` attribute is used to keep track of whether the 15m chart is active or not. The `activate_15m_chart()` and `disable_15m_chart()` methods are provided to set and clear the state of the 15m chart.

2. Flags are introduced to track various aspects of the trading system. Flags such as `weekly_start_flag`, `trading_range_flag`, `losing_trade_flag`, `rsi_exit_flag`, `acceleration_phase_flag`, and `histogram_exit_modifications` are implemented as attributes with corresponding setter and getter methods.

3. The `add_trade_trigger()`, `add_exit_rule()`, and `add_confirmation()` methods are used to add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations to the trading system. Each method takes a `chart` and a `condition` as arguments and adds them to the respective lists (`trade_triggers`, `exit_rules`, `confirmations`).

4. The `enter_trade()` method is responsible for evaluating the trade triggers and entering a trade if any of the conditions are met for the primary time frame. If the 15m chart is active, the `check_15m_confirmation()` method is called to further validate the trade based on the 15m chart's confirmation conditions.

5. The `exit_trade()` method iterates over the exit rules and exits the trade if any of the conditions are met for the primary time frame.

6. The `check_15m_confirmation()` method checks the 15m chart's confirmation conditions to decide whether the trade should be confirmed based on the 15m chart's information.

7. The `update_primary_time_frame()` method is used to update the primary time frame of the trading system. It takes a `time_frame` argument and sets the `primary_time_frame` attribute accordingly.

Overall, the expanded code provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system with the ability to add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. It also allows for easy modification of various aspects of the trading system, such as activating or disabling the 15m chart and setting or clearing different flags.

```

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as capturing the best exits through Flag 11, exceptions to Flag 9, and the Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag.

The `capture_best_exits_flag`, `exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud`, `exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi`, and `candlestick_suspend_trading_flag` attributes are added to keep track of the states of these flags. The corresponding `set_` and `clear_` methods are included to set and clear the states of these flags.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, and Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.

The mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interactions between the trader and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance, including the initialization, adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations, entering and exiting trades, updating the primary time frame, activating and disabling the 15m chart, and setting and clearing flags. The diagram also highlights an example usage of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, demonstrating the steps of entering and exiting trades. This diagram helps to visualize the flow of control between the trader and the trading system and provides a clear understanding of how the different methods and attributes of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class are utilized.

To demonstrate an example scenario, let's consider the following hypothetical scenarios:

1. Activate 15m Chart and Capture Best Exits:
- We activate the 15m chart in the black box trading system to analyze trades.
- We set the capture_best_exits_flag to capture the best exits.
- In this scenario, a trade trigger condition is met on the 1m chart, and the 15m confirmation is checked.
- The trade is entered based on the 1m chart, and the 15m confirmation is met.
- The system logs: "Enter trade based on 1m chart" and "15m confirmation met."

Example log output:
```
Enter trade based on 1m chart
15m confirmation met
```

2. Update Primary Time Frame and Disable 15m Chart:
- We update the primary time frame to 1h in the black box trading system.
- We disable the 15m chart.
- In this scenario, a trade trigger condition is met on the 1h chart.
- The trade is entered based on the 1h chart.
- The system logs: "Enter trade based on 1h chart."

Example log output:
```
Enter trade based on 1h chart
```

3. Set Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag:
- We set the candlestick_suspend_trading_flag in the black box trading system.
- In this scenario, a trade trigger condition is met on the 1m chart, but the candlestick pattern indicates a potential reversal.
- The system logs: "Enter trade based on 1m chart" but does not proceed with the trade due to the Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag.

Example log output:
```
Enter trade based on 1m chart
```

Potential Use Cases:
The code generated provides a flexible framework for implementing a black box trading system. It allows you to define trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations based on different time frames. The system can be used for various trading strategies and can handle advanced concepts such as histogram exit modifications, capturing best exits, exceptions to Flag 9, and the Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag.

Some potential use cases of the code include:
- Building an automated trading bot that follows a specific trading strategy.
- Backtesting different trading strategies using historical data.
- Developing a real-time trading system that analyzes market conditions and executes trades accordingly.
- Implementing custom trading rules and conditions based on individual preferences and market observations.

With this framework, traders can have more control over their trading decisions, incorporate advanced exit rules and exceptions, and adapt the system to different market conditions and time frames.

```

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as capturing the best exits through Flag 11, exceptions to Flag 9, and the Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag.

The `capture_best_exits_flag`, `exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud`, `exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi`, and `candlestick_suspend_trading_flag` attributes are added to keep track of the states of these flags. The corresponding `set_` and `clear_` methods are included to set and clear the states of these flags.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, and Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.

The mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code in the previous message. It shows the interaction between the `Trader` and `BlackBoxTradingSystem` objects.

1. The `Trader` adds trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations to the `BlackBoxTradingSystem`.
2. The `Trader` enters a trade by calling the `enter_trade()` method.
3. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` checks the trade triggers and exit rules based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m).
4. If the trade triggers are met, the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` enters the trade based on the primary time frame.
5. If the 15m chart is active, the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` checks the 15m confirmation.
6. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` exits the trade based on the primary time frame if the exit rules are met.
7. The `Trader` can update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15m chart, set or clear various flags (e.g., weekly start flag, trading range flag), and modify the system behavior.
8. The process can be repeated with different parameters and scenarios as required by the `Trader`.

This sequence diagram demonstrates the flow of the black box trading system and how the `Trader` interacts with it to manage trades based on different conditions and scenarios.

Sure! Here's an example scenario with mocked log output for the code:

```python
bbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()

bbts.add_trade_trigger("5m", "prices close across 5m 13ema")
bbts.add_trade_trigger("1h", "momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma")

bbts.add_exit_rule("5m", "5m exit would result in < 10p profit")
bbts.add_exit_rule("1h", "another 1h exit presents itself")

bbts.add_confirmation("15m", "15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade")

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart
# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart

bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart
# Output: Exit trade based on 1m chart

bbts.update_primary_time_frame("1h")
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart
# Output: Enter trade based on 1h chart
# Output: 15m confirmation met

bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1h chart
# Output: Exit trade based on 1h chart

bbts.activate_15m_chart()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart
# Output: 15m confirmation met

bbts.disable_15m_chart()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked
# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart

bbts.set_weekly_start_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart
# Output: 15m confirmation met

bbts.clear_weekly_start_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked
# Output: Enter trade based on 1m chart

# ... continue with the other scenarios

```

In this example scenario, we go through different scenarios to illustrate the functionality of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class.

1. We set up trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations for different time frames (5m, 1h) using different conditions.
2. We enter and exit trades based on the primary time frame of 1m, and we see the corresponding log output.
3. We update the primary time frame to 1h and see how entering and exiting trades are now based on the 1h chart instead.
4. We activate the 15m chart, and when entering a trade based on the 1m chart, we also check for the 15m confirmation. The log output indicates that both actions are taken.
5. We disable the 15m chart and enter a trade based on the 1m chart without checking the 15m confirmation. The log output shows that only the trade based on the 1m chart is taken.
6. We set and clear the weekly start flag, and observe how it affects the entry of trades and checking of the 15m confirmation.

The mocked log output provides a visual representation of the actions taken by the black box trading system in response to different conditions and scenarios. It helps to understand how the code and system operate in various situations.

The code generated for the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class provides a flexible framework for implementing a black box trading system. It allows users to define trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations for different time frames and conditions. The class can be customized to fit specific trading strategies and rules. Some potential use cases for this code include backtesting trading strategies, creating trading bots, and implementing algorithmic trading systems. It provides a modular and extensible structure for handling trade execution and decision-making based on various market signals and indicators.
## Details
The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class is designed to simulate a black box trading system. It provides methods to add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations for different time frames and conditions. It also allows users to enter and exit trades based on the specified rules, update the primary time frame, and activate or disable the 15m chart.

The class initializes several flags that can be used to control the behavior of the trading system. These flags include the `weekly_start_flag`, `trading_range_flag`, `losing_trade_flag`, `rsi_exit_flag`, `acceleration_phase_flag`, `histogram_exit_modifications`, `capture_best_exits_flag`, `exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud`, `exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi`, and `candlestick_suspend_trading_flag`.

The class provides methods to set and clear these flags, allowing users to modify the trading behavior based on specific scenarios or conditions. For example, the `set_weekly_start_flag` method sets the `weekly_start_flag` to True, indicating that the trading system should take additional actions at the start of each week.

The `enter_trade` method checks the trade triggers for the primary time frame and enters a trade if the conditions are met. It also checks the 15m confirmation if the 15m chart is active.

The `exit_trade` method checks the exit rules for the primary time frame and exits a trade if the conditions are met.

The `check_15m_confirmation` method checks the 15m confirmation for the trade entered based on the primary time frame.

The `update_primary_time_frame` method allows users to update the primary time frame.

The `activate_15m_chart` and `disable_15m_chart` methods set the `is_15m_chart_active` flag to True or False, respectively, indicating whether the 15m chart should be used for confirmations.

Overall, the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class provides a flexible framework for implementing a black box trading system. Users can define trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations, and customize the behavior of the system based on specific flags and conditions.

```

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as ignoring 5m exits when the 1h chart provides full trade support and the Ignore 5m Exits Flag.

The `ignore_5m_exits_flag` attribute is added to keep track of the state of the flag. The corresponding `set_` and `clear_` methods are included to set and clear the state of the flag.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.

The sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interactions between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance. The user sets up the system by adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. Then, the user initiates the trading process by calling the `enter_trade()` method. The system checks the trade triggers and, if the 15m chart is active, verifies the 15m confirmation. The user can update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15m chart, and set or clear various flags that affect the trading behavior. The user can also initiate the exit process by calling the `exit_trade()` method, which checks the exit rules. The trading process can be repeated based on user interaction.

This sequence diagram provides a clear overview of the control flow and interactions in the black box trading system. It visualizes the steps involved in setting up the system, performing trades, and adjusting the trading behavior based on different conditions and flags.

Here's an example scenario with mocked log output of the code:

```python
bbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()

bbts.add_trade_trigger("5m", "prices close across 5m 13ema")
bbts.add_trade_trigger("1h", "momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma")

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart

bbts.update_primary_time_frame("1h")

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart

bbts.activate_15m_chart()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.disable_15m_chart()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_weekly_start_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_weekly_start_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_trading_range_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_trading_range_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_losing_trade_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_losing_trade_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_rsi_exit_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_rsi_exit_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_acceleration_phase_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_acceleration_phase_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_histogram_exit_modifications()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_histogram_exit_modifications()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_capture_best_exits_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_ignore_5m_exits_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation

bbts.clear_ignore_5m_exits_flag()

bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked
```

In this example scenario, we have a `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance `bbts` with various trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations set up. We then call `enter_trade()` at different stages and observe the mocked log output.

Based on the log output, we can see the trades being entered based on the specified chart that meets the given conditions. For example, when the primary time frame is set to 1m, a trade is entered based on a 1m chart trigger. When the primary time frame is updated to 1h, a trade is entered based on a 1h chart trigger. The log output also shows the effect of activating and disabling the 15m chart, setting and clearing different flags, and checking the 15m confirmation.

Potential use cases for the code include implementing and backtesting trading strategies, building trading systems, and automating trading decisions based on specific conditions and triggers. The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class provides a framework to define and manage trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations across different time frames, allowing for flexibility in developing and testing various trading strategies.
## Details
The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class is a Python implementation of a black box trading system. It allows users to define trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations based on different time frames and conditions. The class provides methods to enter and exit trades, update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15m chart, and set or clear various flags that affect the trading behavior.

The class has the following attributes:
- `primary_time_frame`: The primary time frame for trading, default value is "1m".
- `trade_triggers`: A list to store trade triggers, each trigger consists of a chart and a condition.
- `exit_rules`: A list to store exit rules, each rule consists of a chart and a condition.
- `confirmations`: A list to store confirmations, each confirmation consists of a chart and a condition.
- `is_15m_chart_active`: A boolean flag to indicate whether the 15m chart is active or not.
- `weekly_start_flag`: A boolean flag to indicate the weekly start.
- `trading_range_flag`: A boolean flag to indicate the trading range.
- `losing_trade_flag`: A boolean flag to indicate the losing trade.

- `acceleration_phase_flag`: A boolean flag to indicate the acceleration phase.
- `histogram_exit_modifications`: A boolean flag to indicate the histogram exit modifications.
- `capture_best_exits_flag`: A boolean flag to indicate the capture best exits.
- `exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud`: A boolean flag to indicate the exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud.
- `exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi`: A boolean flag to indicate the exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI.
- `candlestick_suspend_trading_flag`: A boolean flag to indicate the candlestick suspend trading.
- `ignore_5m_exits_flag`: A boolean flag to indicate whether to ignore 5m exits.

The class provides the following methods:
- `add_trade_trigger(chart, condition)`: Adds a trade trigger to the `trade_triggers` list.
- `add_exit_rule(chart, condition)`: Adds an exit rule to the `exit_rules` list.
- `add_confirmation(chart, condition)`: Adds a confirmation to the `confirmations` list.
- `enter_trade()`: Enters a trade based on the trade triggers in the `trade_triggers` list. Checks 15m confirmation if the 15m chart is active.
- `exit_trade()`: Exits a trade based on the exit rules in the `exit_rules` list.
- `check_15m_confirmation()`: Checks the 15m confirmation based on the confirmations in the `confirmations` list.
- `update_primary_time_frame(time_frame)`: Updates the primary time frame for trading.
- `activate_15m_chart()`: Activates the 15m chart.
- `disable_15m_chart()`: Disables the 15m chart.
- `set_weekly_start_flag()`: Sets the weekly start flag.

- `set_rsi_exit_flag()`: Sets the RSI exit flag.
- `clear_rsi_exit_flag()`: Clears the RSI exit flag.
- `set_acceleration_phase_flag()`: Sets the acceleration phase flag.
- `clear_acceleration_phase_flag()`: Clears the acceleration phase flag.
- `set_histogram_exit_modifications()`: Sets the histogram exit modifications flag.
- `clear_histogram_exit_modifications()`: Clears the histogram exit modifications flag.
- `set_capture_best_exits_flag()`: Sets the capture best exits flag.
- `clear_capture_best_exits_flag()`: Clears the capture best exits flag.
- `set_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()`: Sets the exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud flag.
- `clear_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()`: Clears the exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud flag.
- `set_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()`: Sets the exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI flag.
- `clear_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()`: Clears the exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI flag.
- `set_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()`: Sets the Candlestick Suspend Trading flag.
- `clear_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()`: Clears the Candlestick Suspend Trading flag
- `set_ignore_5m_exits_flag()`: Sets the Ignore 5m Exits flag.
- `clear_ignore_5m_exits_flag()`: Clears the Ignore 5m Exits flag.

The example usage demonstrates how to set up the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance and use its methods. The user can add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations, enter and exit trades based on the primary time frame, update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15m chart, and set or clear various flags. The user can also check the 15m confirmation and enter trades based on the current chart and conditions.

The sequence diagram visualizes the interactions between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` instance. It shows the steps involved in setting up the system, performing trades, and adjusting the trading behavior based on different conditions, flags, and user interactions. The diagram helps provide a clear understanding of the control flow and the exchanges between the user and the system.

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as ignoring 5m exits when the 1h chart provides full trade support and the Ignore 5m Exits Flag.

The `ignore_5m_exits_flag` attribute is added to keep track of the state of the flag. The corresponding `set_` and `clear_` methods are included to set and clear the state of the flag.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m). After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a more comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.

The sequence diagram represents the flow of control in the code provided. It starts by creating an instance of the BlackBoxTradingSystem class and adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. The trader then enters and exits trades based on the current primary time frame. The sequence diagram includes various steps for activating and disabling the 15m chart, setting and clearing different flags, and entering trades based on the 1m chart with or without checking the 15m confirmation. The diagram shows the interaction between the trader and the BlackBoxTradingSystem class, illustrating the control flow for different scenarios and conditions.

To illustrate the usage of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we have set up a trading system with specific trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. We will simulate the log output of the code to show the flow of entering and exiting trades based on different conditions.

```python
bbts = BlackBoxTradingSystem()

# Adding trade triggers
bbts.add_trade_trigger("5m", "prices close across 5m 13ema")
bbts.add_trade_trigger("1h", "momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma")

# Adding exit rules
bbts.add_exit_rule("5m", "5m exit would result in < 10p profit")
bbts.add_exit_rule("1h", "another 1h exit presents itself")

# Adding confirmations
bbts.add_confirmation("15m", "15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade")

# Entering and exiting trades
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart
bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1m chart

bbts.update_primary_time_frame("1h")
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1h chart
bbts.exit_trade()  # Exit trade based on 1h chart

bbts.activate_15m_chart()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.disable_15m_chart()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_weekly_start_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_weekly_start_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_trading_range_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_trading_range_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_losing_trade_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_losing_trade_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_rsi_exit_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_rsi_exit_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_acceleration_phase_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_acceleration_phase_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_histogram_exit_modifications()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_histogram_exit_modifications()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_capture_best_exits_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_capture_best_exits_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_candlestick_suspend_trading_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked

bbts.set_ignore_5m_exits_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
bbts.clear_ignore_5m_exits_flag()
bbts.enter_trade()  # Enter trade based on 1m chart, 15m confirmation not checked
```

Here's the expected log output based on the setup:

```
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Exit trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1h chart
Exit trade based on 1h chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Enter trade based on 1m chart and check 15m confirmation
Enter trade based on 1m chart
```

In this example scenario, we simulate the log output to demonstrate the flows of entering and exiting trades based on different conditions and settings of the black box trading system.

The hypothetical scenarios we mocked include:

- Entering and exiting trades based on different time frames: We start by entering and exiting trades based on the default primary time frame of 1 minute (1m chart), then update the primary time frame to 1 hour (1h chart) and enter and exit trades accordingly.

- 15-minute chart usage: We activate the 15-minute chart and observe that when the 1-minute chart triggers a trade, we also check for 15-minute confirmation before entering the trade.

- Specific flags and scenarios: We set and clear various flags such as the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications flag, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud flag, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI flag, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag. We observe how these flags affect the trade entry process based on the 1-minute chart.

The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class provides a flexible and modular framework to design and execute black box trading strategies. It allows users to define and manage trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations for different time frames. It also provides the ability to set and clear various flags to customize the trading behavior based on specific conditions and scenarios. The class can be used to implement a wide range of trading strategies with different rules and conditions, providing a powerful tool for algorithmic trading.

The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class is expanded with more detailed logic to provide a comprehensive implementation of a black box trading system incorporating the features mentioned in the provided code snippet.

The class includes an `__init__` method to initialize all the attributes representing the different components of the trading system. The attributes include the primary time frame, trade triggers, exit rules, confirmations, and various flags to control the behavior of the trading system.

The class provides methods to add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations. These methods allow users to specify the chart and condition for each component.

The `enter_trade` method iterates through the trade triggers and checks if the condition is met for the primary time frame. If the condition is met, it prints a message indicating that a trade should be entered. Additionally, if the 15-minute chart is active, the method calls the `check_15m_confirmation` method.

The `exit_trade` method iterates through the exit rules and checks if the condition is met for the primary time frame. If the condition is met, it prints a message indicating that a trade should be exited.

The `check_15m_confirmation` method iterates through the confirmations and checks if the condition is met for the 15-minute chart. If the condition is met, it prints a message indicating that the 15-minute confirmation is met.

The class also includes methods to update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15-minute chart, set or clear various flags like weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications flag, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud flag, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI flag, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag.

The code snippet provided shows an example usage of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, where trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations are added. Trades are entered and exited based on the specified time frames and conditions. The primary time frame is updated, the 15-minute chart is activated and disabled, and various flags are set and cleared to customize the behavior of the trading system. The log output demonstrates the sequence of entering and exiting trades based on the specified conditions and settings.

The sequence diagram illustrates the flow of control in the code snippet, showing the interaction between the trader and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class. It represents the steps involved in adding trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations, entering and exiting trades based on the primary time frame, updating the primary time frame, activating and disabling the 15-minute chart, and setting and clearing various flags. The sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow and interaction between the trader and the trading system.

The Python class `BlackBoxTradingSystem` is updated to include the additional concepts from the snippet, such as additional exit rules and parameters for long-term backtesting.

The `additional_exit_rules` attribute is added to store the additional exit rules. The `add_additional_exit_rule` method is included to add new exit rules to the system.

In the example usage, we add trade triggers, exit rules, and confirmations as before. We also add additional exit rules based on the shooting star and hammer patterns. We then enter and exit trades based on the current primary time frame (default is 1m) and check if the additional exit rules are met. After updating the primary time frame to 1h, we enter and exit trades based on the 1h chart and evaluate the additional exit rules. We activate and disable the 15m chart, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation. We also set and clear the weekly start flag, trading range flag, losing trade flag, RSI exit flag, acceleration phase flag, histogram exit modifications, capture best exits flag, exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud, exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI, Candlestick Suspend Trading Flag, and Ignore 5m Exits Flag, and enter trades based on the 1m chart with and without checking the 15m confirmation.

This class provides a comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the advanced ideas from the snippet. It allows for more flexibility and control over the trading decisions based on different time frames, additional exit rules, and the specific conditions and scenarios outlined in the snippet.

The sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message. It shows the interactions between the user and the `TradingSystem` object, including adding trade triggers, exit rules, confirmations, additional exit rules, and setting flags and parameters. It then depicts the sequence of entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and conditions.

The diagram highlights the loops for checking the 15m chart confirmation, updating the primary time frame, and activating/disabling the 15m chart. It also shows the steps for entering trades, printing messages based on the trade triggers and confirmations, exiting trades, and printing additional exit rule met.

The diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow, showcasing the interactions between the user and the trading system and the logical sequence of steps involved in executing trades and evaluating conditions.

I'll provide an example scenario with mocked log output for the code:

```python
bbts.activate_15m_chart()
bbts.set_capture_best_exits_flag()
bbts.add_trade_trigger("5m", "prices close across 5m 13ema")
bbts.add_trade_trigger("1h", "momentum reflected thru histogram & RSIma")
bbts.add_exit_rule("5m", "5m exit would result in < 10p profit")
bbts.add_exit_rule("1h", "another 1h exit presents itself")
bbts.add_confirmation("15m", "15m RSIma crosses 0 in favor of trade")
bbts.add_additional_exit_rule("shooting star high is the highest high for 8 bars")
bbts.add_additional_exit_rule("hammer low is the lowest low for 8 bars")
bbts.add_additional_exit_rule("raw RSI > 70 for shooting star exit")
bbts.add_additional_exit_rule("raw RSI < 30 for hammer exit")

bbts.enter_trade()
bbts.exit_trade()
```

Mocked log output:
```
Enter trade based on 1m chart
Exit trade based on 1m chart
Additional exit rule met
```

The hypothetical scenario we mocked involves activating the 15m chart and enabling capturing the best exits. We added trade triggers for the 5m and 1h charts, exit rules for the 5m and 1h charts, and a confirmation for the 15m chart. Additionally, we included additional exit rules for the shooting star and hammer patterns.

In this scenario, the system enters a trade based on the trade triggers on the 1m chart. It then exits the trade based on the exit rules on the 1m chart. Since we added additional exit rules for the shooting star and hammer patterns, the system also checks if these conditions are met and finds that the additional exit rule has been met.

This example demonstrates the flexibility of the code to incorporate different time frames, additional exit rules, and trade confirmations. The code can be used to build and test advanced trading strategies that utilize multiple charts, additional exit conditions, and other parameters to optimize trade decisions. It provides a framework for systematically defining and implementing complex trading rules and conditions.
## Details
The expanded code includes a comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system with additional features such as checking confirmation on a 15-minute chart, setting and clearing various flags, and adding additional exit rules.

The `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class includes the following attributes to keep track of the system's state:

- `primary_time_frame`: Stores the primary time frame for trade triggers and exit rules (default is "1m").
- `trade_triggers`: Stores the trade triggers as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the chart and the condition.
- `exit_rules`: Stores the exit rules as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the chart and the condition.
- `confirmations`: Stores the confirmations as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the chart and the condition.
- `additional_exit_rules`: Stores the additional exit rules as a list of conditions.
- `is_15m_chart_active`: Indicates whether the 15-minute chart is active or not.
- `weekly_start_flag`: Indicates whether the weekly start flag is set.
- `trading_range_flag`: Indicates whether the trading range flag is set.
- `losing_trade_flag`: Indicates whether the losing trade flag is set.
- `rsi_exit_flag`: Indicates whether the RSI exit flag is set.
- `acceleration_phase_flag`: Indicates whether the acceleration phase flag is set.
- `histogram_exit_modifications`: Indicates whether the histogram exit modifications flag is set.
- `capture_best_exits_flag`: Indicates whether the capture best exits flag is set.
- `exception_to_flag_9_blue_cloud`: Indicates whether the exception to Flag 9 - Blue Cloud flag is set.
- `exception_to_flag_9_extreme_rsi`: Indicates whether the exception to Flag 9 - Extreme RSI flag is set.
- `candlestick_suspend_trading_flag`: Indicates whether the Candlestick Suspend Trading flag is set.
- `ignore_5m_exits_flag`: Indicates whether the Ignore 5m Exits flag is set.

The class includes various methods to add trade triggers, exit rules, confirmations, and additional exit rules. These methods append the given conditions to the appropriate lists.

The `enter_trade` method iterates over the trade triggers and checks if the chart matches the primary time frame and if the condition is met. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints a message indicating that a trade should be entered. If the 15-minute chart is active, it calls the `check_15m_confirmation` method.

The `exit_trade` method iterates over the exit rules and checks if the chart matches the primary time frame and if the condition is met. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints a message indicating that a trade should be exited. It then iterates over the additional exit rules and checks if each condition is met, printing a message for each condition that is satisfied.

The `check_15m_confirmation` method iterates over the confirmations and checks if the chart is "15m" and if the condition is met. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints a message indicating that the 15m confirmation is met.

The class also includes various methods to update the primary time frame, activate or disable the 15-minute chart, and set or clear the flags and parameters.

The example usage showcases the usage of the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class and demonstrates entering and exiting trades based on different time frames and conditions, activating and disabling the 15-minute chart, and setting and clearing various flags and parameters.

The sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the user and the `BlackBoxTradingSystem` class, showcasing the steps involved in adding trade triggers, exit rules, confirmations, and additional exit rules, setting flags and parameters, entering and exiting trades, and checking 15-minute chart confirmation.

The hypothetical scenario with mocked log output demonstrates the use of the code by activating the 15-minute chart, enabling capturing the best exits, and adding trade triggers, exit rules, confirmations, and additional exit rules. It then enters and exits a trade based on the trade triggers and exit rules on the 1-minute chart, and checks if the additional exit rule is met.

Overall, the expanded code provides a comprehensive implementation of the black box trading system, incorporating the additional features and providing flexibility to define and evaluate complex trading rules and conditions.
