It shows the interaction between the user, the `CodeCompletionModel`, and its internal components (`LongCoder`, `SlidingWindow`, `BridgeTokens`, and `MemoryTokens`).\n\n1. The user initiates the code completion process by calling the `complete_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel`.\n2.

The code includes an import statement and a function definition.\n\nThe `CodeCompletionModel` class is instantiated, and the `complete_code` method is called with the input code. The completed code is then printed.\n\nFor the mocked log output, we see the different steps performed in the code completion process:\n\n- Preprocessed Code: The input code is preprocessed, which may involve any necessary transformations or cleaning.\n- Sliding Window Applied: The sliding window mechanism is applied to focus on the local context of the code.\n- Bridge Tokens Aggregated: Bridge tokens are used to aggregate local information and facilitate global interaction.\n- Memory Tokens Highlighted: Memory tokens are used to highlight and memorize important statements such as import statements.\n- Completed Code: The code completion process is complete, and the final completed code is returned.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): The code completion model can be integrated into IDEs to assist developers in writing code more efficiently.

The `SlidingWindow` class applies the sliding window mechanism, the `BridgeTokens` class aggregates local information, and the `MemoryTokens` class highlights and memorizes important statements.\n\nThe `GPT-C` and `CodeGPT` classes represent other models that can be used for code completion. They have their own specific methods and components.\n\nThis code provides a simplified representation of the concepts discussed in the paper, demonstrating how different components and models can be used for code completion.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant CodeCompletionModel\n    participant LongCoder\n    participant GPT_C\n    participant CodeGPT\n\n    User->>CodeCompletionModel: complete_code(code)\n    alt LongCoder Model\n        CodeCompletionModel->>LongCoder: complete(code)\n        LongCoder->>SlidingWindow: apply(code)\n        SlidingWindow->>SlidingWindow: Process code\n        LongCoder->>BridgeTokens: aggregate(local_context)\n        BridgeTokens->>BridgeTokens: Process local_context\n        LongCoder->>MemoryTokens: highlight(code)\n        MemoryTokens->>MemoryTokens: Process code\n        LongCoder->>LongCoder: Perform code completion\n        LongCoder-->>CodeCompletionModel: completed_code\n    else GPT-C Model\n        CodeCompletionModel->>GPT_C: complete(code)\n        GPT_C-->>CodeCompletionModel: completed_code\n    else CodeGPT Model\n        CodeCompletionModel->>CodeGPT: complete(code)\n        CodeGPT-->>CodeCompletionModel: completed_code\n    end\n    CodeCompletionModel-->>User: completed_code\n```\n\nThis sequence diagram represents the control flow of the code completion process using different models, as illustrated in the previous code.\n\nThe `User` initiates the code completion process by calling the `complete_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel`. \n\nIf the model type is `LongCoder`, the control flows into the `LongCoder` model. The `CodeCompletionModel` passes the code to the `LongCoder` and the `LongCoder` applies the sliding window mechanism by calling the `apply` method of the `SlidingWindow`. The `SlidingWindow` processes the code and returns the local context. Then, the `LongCoder` uses the `BridgeTokens` to aggregate the local information by calling the `aggregate` method. The `MemoryTokens` highlight and memorize important statements in the code by calling the `highlight` method. Finally, the `LongCoder` performs the code completion and returns the completed code to the `CodeCompletionModel`. The `CodeCompletionModel` then returns the completed code to the `User`.\n\nIf the model type is `GPT-C` or `CodeGPT`, the control flows directly to the respective model. The `CodeCompletionModel` passes the code to the chosen model (`GPT-C` or `CodeGPT`) and the model performs the code completion. The completed code is returned to the `CodeCompletionModel`, which in turn returns it to the `User`.\n\nThis sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the control flow in the code, illustrating how the different models are used to complete the code.\n\nExample scenario:\n```python\nmodel = CodeCompletionModel(model_type=\"LongCoder\")\ncode = \"\"\"\ndef calculate_sum(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nresult = calculate_sum(3, 5)\nprint(result)\n\"\"\"\n\ncompleted_code = model.complete_code(code)\nprint(completed_code)\n```\n\nHypothetical scenarios:\n1. In this scenario, we have a code completion model called `CodeCompletionModel` initialized with the model type \"LongCoder\". The input code is a simple function that calculates the sum of two numbers and assigns the result to a variable. The completed code is expected to suggest the missing parts, such as imports, function definitions, or any other relevant code.\n\n2. The `complete_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel` class is called with the input code as the argument. The model preprocesses the code and then uses the `LongCoder` model to complete it. The completed code is stored in the `completed_code` variable.\n\n3. The completed code is printed, which should include the missing parts and suggestions to make the code complete. For example, it might suggest importing the necessary modules or provide suggestions for completing the function definition.\n\nPotential use cases:\n- Code editors or IDEs could integrate the `CodeCompletionModel` to provide intelligent code completion suggestions to developers as they write code. This can help improve productivity by saving time and reducing errors.\n- The `CodeCompletionModel` can be used in automated code generation tools to generate code snippets or templates based on the provided context. This can be useful for tasks like scaffolding or generating repetitive sections of code.\n- Code review tools could leverage the `CodeCompletionModel` to provide suggestions for completing incomplete code snippets, allowing developers to write more robust and error-free code.\n- Educational platforms or coding tutorials could incorporate the `CodeCompletionModel` to provide hints and suggestions to learners as they complete coding exercises or assignments, helping them learn and understand programming concepts more effectively.",

The model then processes the code using the `LongCoder` model and returns the completed code.\n\nThe completed code suggests adding an additional if statement inside the for loop to break the loop if the `total` variable exceeds 100. This can be seen from the mocked log output.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): The code completion model can be integrated into IDEs to provide intelligent suggestions and auto-completion for developers as they write code.\n- Code Editors: Code editors, both online and offline, can leverage the code completion model to provide real-time suggestions and help users write code more efficiently.\n- Code Analysis Tools: Code analysis tools can use the code completion model to analyze and suggest improvements for existing codebases, leading to better code quality and maintainability.\n- Education: The code completion model can be used as a teaching tool to help students learn programming concepts by providing hints and suggestions as they solve coding exercises.\n- Code Generation: The code completion model can be used in code generation tasks, where generating code based on a given input or template is required.\n\nOverall, the code completion model can assist developers and code-related tools by providing suggestions and automating code writing processes, improving productivity and reducing errors.",

It can be initialized with different model types, such as \"LongCoder\", \"GPT-C\", or \"CodeGPT\". The `create_model` method is used to create the specific model based on the given model type.\n\nThe `LongCoder` class is one of the models that the `CodeCompletionModel` can use. It has components like `WindowAttention`, `BridgeAttention`, and `GlobalAttention` to handle different types of attention. The `WindowAttention` class applies window attention to handle local dependencies, the `BridgeAttention` class applies bridge attention to handle distant dependencies, and the `GlobalAttention` class applies global attention to aggregate information.\n\nThe `GPT-C` and `CodeGPT` classes represent other models that can be used for code completion. They have their own specific methods and components.\n\nThis code provides a simplified representation of the concepts discussed in the paper, demonstrating how different components and models can be used for code completion with LongCoder as an example.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Model as CodeCompletionModel\n    participant LongCoder\n    participant WindowAttention\n    participant BridgeAttention\n    participant GlobalAttention\n\n    User ->> Model: complete_code(code)  # Step 1\n    \n    alt Model Type: LongCoder\n        Model ->> LongCoder: complete(code)  # Step 2\n        \n        LongCoder ->> WindowAttention: apply(code)  # Step 3\n        WindowAttention -->> LongCoder: window_attention_output\n        \n        LongCoder ->> BridgeAttention: apply(code)  # Step 4\n        BridgeAttention -->> LongCoder: bridge_attention_output\n        \n        LongCoder ->> GlobalAttention: apply(code)  # Step 5\n        GlobalAttention -->> LongCoder: global_attention_output\n        \n        LongCoder ->> CodeCompletion: code_completion(window_attention_output, bridge_attention_output, global_attention_output)  # Step 6\n\n    else Model Type: GPT-C or CodeGPT\n        Model ->> Model Type: complete(code)  # Step 2\n        \n        Model Type ->> Model: completed_code  # Step 3\n    end\n    \n    Model -->> User: completed_code  # Step 7\n```\n\nIn this sequence diagram, the control flow of the code is illustrated. Here are the steps explained:\n\n1. The user calls the `complete_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel` object with the `code` parameter.\n2. Depending on the model type specified, either LongCoder or another model (GPT-C or CodeGPT), the control flow diverges.\n3. For the LongCoder model:\n   - The `complete` method of the LongCoder object is called with the `code` parameter.\n   - The LongCoder object applies window attention (`WindowAttention`), bridge attention (`BridgeAttention`), and global attention (`GlobalAttention`).\n   - Each attention mechanism returns an output.\n   - The LongCoder object performs code completion using the outputs of the attention mechanisms.\n4. For other model types (GPT-C or CodeGPT):\n   - The `complete` method of the relevant model type is called with the `code` parameter.\n   - The model type performs code completion and returns the completed code.\n5. The completed code is returned from the `complete_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel` object to the user.\n\nHere's an example scenario with mocked log output for the CodeCompletionModel class:\n\n```python\n# Create an instance of the CodeCompletionModel\nmodel = CodeCompletionModel(\"LongCoder\")\n\n# Provide a code snippet to complete\ncode = \"def calculate_sum(a, b):\"\n\n# Complete the code using the LongCoder model\ncompleted_code = model.complete_code(code)\n\nprint(completed_code)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\ndef calculate_sum(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, we have created an instance of the CodeCompletionModel with the model type \"LongCoder\". We then provide a code snippet that requires completion, which is a function definition for calculating the sum of two numbers. We use the `complete_code` method of the model to generate the completed code.\n\nThe completion output suggests adding a return statement to the code snippet, completing the function definition by adding the necessary logic to calculate the sum of the given numbers. The completed code is then printed to the console.\n\nPotential use cases of the CodeCompletionModel class include code development environments (IDEs) or code editors that provide code completion features. The model can be used to assist developers by suggesting and generating code based on the context, saving time and effort. The flexibility to choose different model types allows for experimentation and comparison of various code completion approaches.",

The CodeCompletionModel receives this request and preprocesses the code. Then, the CodeCompletionModel passes the preprocessed code to the LongCoder model.\n\nInside the LongCoder model, the code goes through different types of attention. First, it enters the WindowAttention component, which handles local dependencies. Then, it moves to the BridgeAttention component, which handles distant dependencies. Finally, the code is passed to the GlobalAttention component, which aggregates information.\n\nAfter applying the different types of attention, the LongCoder performs the code completion based on the attention outputs. The completed code is returned back to the CodeCompletionModel, which then returns it to the User.\n\nThis sequence diagram helps visualize the control flow of the code completion process and the interactions between the different components involved.\n\n```python\nmodel = CodeCompletionModel(\"LongCoder\")\ncode = \"\"\"\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nresult = add(3, 4)\nprint(result)\n\"\"\"\n\ncompleted_code = model.complete_code(code)\nprint(completed_code)\n```\n\nMocked Log Output:\n```\n[INFO] Preprocessing the code...\n[INFO] Applying window attention...\n[INFO] Applying bridge attention...\n[INFO] Applying global attention...\n[INFO] Performing code completion...\n[INFO] Code completion completed successfully.\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nresult = add(3, 4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example scenario, we have a `CodeCompletionModel` object initialized with the model type \"LongCoder\". We provide a code snippet as input, which calculates the sum of two numbers and prints the result.\n\nThe log output shows the steps involved in the code completion process. First, the code is preprocessed. Then, the window attention, bridge attention, and global attention are applied, each generating the corresponding output. Finally, the code completion is performed, and the completed code is printed.\n\nThe completed code is the same as the input code since we haven't implemented the logic for code completion in this example. However, in a real scenario, the `complete_code` method would generate suggestions or automatically complete the code based on the context provided.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n- Code editors or IDEs: The `CodeCompletionModel` can be integrated into code editors or IDEs to provide intelligent code completion suggestions to developers as they write code.\n- Automated code generation: The `CodeCompletionModel` can be used to automatically generate code snippets or complete code templates based on incomplete or partial code provided as input.\n- Code analysis and understanding: The `CodeCompletionModel` can assist in analyzing and understanding existing code by providing completion suggestions or predicting missing code elements.",

It can be initialized with different model types, such as \"LongCoder\", \"GPT-2\", \"CodeGPT\", or \"UniXcoder\". The `create_model` method is used to create the specific model based on the given model type.\n\nThe `LongCoder` class is one of the models that the `CodeCompletionModel` can use. It has components like `WindowAttention`, `BridgeAttention`, and `GlobalAttention` to handle different types of attention. The `WindowAttention` class applies window attention to handle local dependencies, the `BridgeAttention` class applies bridge attention to handle distant dependencies, and the `GlobalAttention` class applies global attention to aggregate information.\n\nThe `GPT-2`, `CodeGPT`, and `UniXcoder` classes represent other models that can be used for code completion. They have their own specific methods and components.\n\nThis code provides a simplified representation of the concepts discussed in the paper, demonstrating how different components and models can be used for code completion with LongCoder as an example.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant CodeCompletionModel\n    participant LongCoder\n    participant WindowAttention\n    participant BridgeAttention\n    participant GlobalAttention\n\n    User->>CodeCompletionModel: complete_code(code)\n    CodeCompletionModel->>CodeCompletionModel: preprocess_code(code)\n    CodeCompletionModel->>LongCoder: complete(preprocessed_code)\n    LongCoder->>WindowAttention: apply(code)\n    LongCoder->>BridgeAttention: apply(code)\n    LongCoder->>GlobalAttention: apply(code)\n    WindowAttention-->>LongCoder: window_attention_output\n    BridgeAttention-->>LongCoder: bridge_attention_output\n    GlobalAttention-->>LongCoder: global_attention_output\n    LongCoder-->>LongCoder: code_completion(...)\n    LongCoder-->>CodeCompletionModel: completed_code\n    CodeCompletionModel-->>User: completed_code\n```\n\nThis sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code in the previous message.\n\nThe `User` initiates the code completion process by calling the `complete_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel`. The code provided by the user is then preprocessed by the `preprocess_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel`.\n\nThe `CodeCompletionModel` passes the preprocessed code to the `LongCoder` model. The `LongCoder` model performs code completion by applying the `WindowAttention`, `BridgeAttention`, and `GlobalAttention` components to handle different types of dependencies in the code.\n\nThe `WindowAttention`, `BridgeAttention`, and `GlobalAttention` components return their respective attention outputs to the `LongCoder` model. The `LongCoder` model then performs code completion based on the attention outputs.\n\nThe completed code is returned from the `LongCoder` model to the `CodeCompletionModel`, and finally returned to the `User`.\n\nThis sequence diagram helps illustrate the flow of control and data between the different components involved in the code completion process.\n\n```python\nmodel = CodeCompletionModel(\"LongCoder\")\ncompleted_code = model.complete_code(\"def add(a, b):\")\nprint(completed_code)\n```\n\nMocked log output:\n```\nPreprocessed code: def add(a, b):\nApplying window attention...\nWindow attention output: [hidden states]\nApplying bridge attention...\nBridge attention output: [hidden states]\nApplying global attention...\nGlobal attention output: [hidden states]\nPerforming code completion...\nCompleted code: def add(a, b):\\n    return a + b\n```\n\nIn this example scenario, we have an instance of the `CodeCompletionModel` class created with the \"LongCoder\" model type. We use the `complete_code` method to provide a code snippet (`\"def add(a, b):\"`) and get the completed code. \n\nThe mocked log output shows the steps involved in code completion. The code snippet is preprocessed, and then the window attention, bridge attention, and global attention are applied successively. Finally, the completed code is generated using the attention outputs.\n\nThis scenario showcases how the code completion model can take a code snippet and generate the completed code. The different attention mechanisms in LongCoder help capture local and global dependencies, enabling the model to provide accurate code suggestions. \n\nPotential use cases of the code include code editors and IDEs, where developers can benefit from code completion to speed up their coding process. The model can provide relevant suggestions, autocomplete code, and assist developers in writing code more efficiently and accurately.",

The attention outputs are passed to the `Model` (not specified in detail) to complete the code based on the attention information.\n8. The completed code is returned to the `LongCoder`.\n9. The completed code is returned from the `LongCoder` to the `CodeCompletionModel`.\n10. Finally, the completed code is returned from the `CodeCompletionModel` to the User.\n\nThis diagram shows the control flow and interactions between different components involved in code completion using the `CodeCompletionModel` and `LongCoder` classes.\n\n```python\n# Example scenario\nmodel = CodeCompletionModel(\"LongCoder\")\ncode = \"def add_two_numbers(a, b):\"  # Incomplete code\ncompleted_code = model.complete_code(code)\n\nprint(completed_code)\n\n# Mocked log output\n\"\"\"\ndef add_two_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\"\"\"\n\n# Explanation of the scenario\nIn this example scenario, we have a code completion model instantiated as `model` with the model type \"LongCoder\". We have an incomplete code fragment `code` that represents a function definition for adding two numbers. We want to use the code completion model to suggest the completion of the code.\n\nThe `complete_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel` class is called with the `code` as input. This method applies any necessary preprocessing steps to the code and uses the LongCoder model to complete the code. The completed code is stored in the `completed_code` variable.\n\nThe `completed_code` is then printed, which shows the suggested completion of the code by the LongCoder model. In this case, it completes the function definition by adding the line `return a + b`, which represents the addition of the two numbers.\n\nThis example demonstrates how the code completion model can take an incomplete code fragment and provide suggestions for completing the code based on the given context.\n\nPotential use cases of the code generated in the previous message include code editors or IDEs where developers can benefit from code completion. The model can suggest completions for code snippets, function definitions, or other coding structures, helping developers write code more efficiently and accurately. It can also assist in understanding and navigating code by providing suggestions based on the context of the code.",

It can be initialized with different model types, such as \"LongCoder\", \"GPT-2\", \"CodeGPT\", or \"UniXcoder\". The `create_model` method is used to create the specific model based on the given model type.\n\nThe `LongCoder` class is one of the models that the `CodeCompletionModel` can use. It has components like `WindowAttention`, `BridgeAttention`, and `GlobalAttention` to handle different types of attention. The `WindowAttention` class applies window attention to handle local dependencies, the `BridgeAttention` class applies bridge attention to handle distant dependencies, and the `GlobalAttention` class applies global attention to aggregate information.\n\nThe `GPT-2`, `CodeGPT`, and `UniXcoder` classes represent other models that can be used for code completion. They have their own specific methods and components.\n\nThis code provides a simplified representation of the concepts discussed in the paper, demonstrating how different components and models can be used for code completion with LongCoder as an example.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant CodeCompletionModel\n    participant LongCoder\n    participant WindowAttention\n    participant BridgeAttention\n    participant GlobalAttention\n\n    User->CodeCompletionModel: complete_code(code)\n    CodeCompletionModel-->User: completed_code\n\n    Note over CodeCompletionModel: Preprocessing\n    CodeCompletionModel->LongCoder: complete(preprocessed_code)\n    LongCoder->WindowAttention: apply(code)\n    WindowAttention-->LongCoder: window_attention_output\n    LongCoder->BridgeAttention: apply(code)\n    BridgeAttention-->LongCoder: bridge_attention_output\n    LongCoder->GlobalAttention: apply(code)\n    GlobalAttention-->LongCoder: global_attention_output\n    LongCoder->LongCoder: code_completion(window_attention_output, bridge_attention_output, global_attention_output)\n    LongCoder-->CodeCompletionModel: completed_code\n\n    Note over LongCoder: Other methods and classes specific to LongCoder\n```\n\nThis sequence diagram illustrates the control flow of the code provided in the previous message, focusing on the interaction between the User, CodeCompletionModel, and LongCoder.\n\n1. The User initiates the code completion process by calling the `complete_code` method of the CodeCompletionModel object and passing the code as a parameter.\n2. The CodeCompletionModel object receives the code and performs any necessary preprocessing steps.\n3. The CodeCompletionModel object invokes the `complete` method of the LongCoder object, passing the preprocessed code.\n4. The LongCoder object utilizes its internal components, including WindowAttention, BridgeAttention, and GlobalAttention, to process the code and generate attention outputs.\n5. The LongCoder object performs code completion based on the attention outputs, resulting in the completed code.\n6. The LongCoder object returns the completed code to the CodeCompletionModel object.\n7. The CodeCompletionModel object returns the completed code to the User.\n\nPlease note that the diagram includes a note indicating the presence of other methods and classes specific to LongCoder, which are not shown in detail for simplicity.\n\n```python\nmodel_type = \"LongCoder\"\ncode = \"def add(a, b):\"\n\ncc_model = CodeCompletionModel(model_type)\ncompleted_code = cc_model.complete_code(code)\n\nprint(completed_code)\n```\n\nMocked Log Output:\n```\n\"def add(a, b):\\n    return a + b\"\n```\n\nIn this example scenario, we create an instance of the `CodeCompletionModel` class with the model type \"LongCoder\". We then call the `complete_code` method of the model to complete the given code snippet. \n\nThe input code is `def add(a, b):`, and the expected completed code is `\"def add(a, b):\\n    return a + b\"`. This means that the model generates a completion for the code snippet, adding a line to return the sum of the two input parameters.\n\nThe logged output shows the completed code, which is `\"def add(a, b):\\n    return a + b\"`.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): The code completion model can be integrated into IDEs to provide intelligent code suggestions and completions to developers as they write code.\n- Code Editors: Code editors can use the code completion model to auto-complete code snippets and provide suggestions to users, improving their coding efficiency.\n- Code Generation: The model can be used to generate code snippets based on a given context, helping developers with repetitive tasks or providing boilerplate code.\n- Code Understanding: The code completion model can assist in understanding and navigating code bases by providing suggestions and completions based on the existing code context.\n  \nOverall, the code completion model enhances the developer experience by providing accurate and context-aware code suggestions, improving productivity and reducing manual coding efforts.",

The user initiates the code completion process by calling the `complete_code` method of `CodeCompletionModel`.\n2. `CodeCompletionModel` preprocesses the code before passing it to the specified model.\n3. `CodeCompletionModel` creates the specified model (e.g., `LongCoder`, etc.).\n4.

Here's an example scenario with mocked log output:\n\n```python\n# Create a CodeCompletionModel instance with the LongCoder model\nmodel = CodeCompletionModel(\"LongCoder\")\n\n# Provide a code snippet to complete\ncode = \"\"\"\ndef calculate_sum(a, b):\n    sum = a + b\n    return sum\n\nprint(calculate_sum(2, 3))\n\"\"\"\n\n# Complete the code using the LongCoder model\ncompleted_code = model.complete_code(code)\n\n# Log the completed code\nprint(completed_code)\n```\n\nMocked log output:\n```\ndef calculate_sum(a, b):\n    sum = a + b\n    return sum\n\nprint(calculate_sum(2, 3))\n\ndef calculate_difference(a, b):\n    difference = a - b\n    return difference\n\nprint(calculate_difference(2, 3))\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `CodeCompletionModel` instance with the LongCoder model. We provide a code snippet that defines a `calculate_sum` function and prints its result. We then use the `complete_code` method of the `CodeCompletionModel` to complete the code. The completed code, which includes the definition of a `calculate_difference` function and its usage, is logged to the console.\n\nThe scenario demonstrates how the LongCoder model can suggest additional code based on the provided snippet. In this case, it suggests the definition and usage of a `calculate_difference` function.\n\nThe potential use cases of the code generated in the previous message include code completion tasks, where the model suggests and completes code based on the given context. The `CodeCompletionModel` class, along with the specific models like LongCoder, GPT-2, CodeGPT, and UniXcoder, can be used in software development tools and integrated development environments (IDEs) to assist developers in writing code more efficiently and accurately. The models can provide intelligent code suggestions, help with code generation, and improve the productivity of developers."
