Memory Augmented Large Language Models are

1.
Large language models, like GPT-2 and GPT-3, have gained popularity for their ability to answer questions and generate text
 However, these models have a limitation - they can only process input strings of a certain length
 To overcome this limitation, researchers have explored augmenting these models with external memory
 In this paper, the authors show that by adding an associative read-write memory to a large language model called Flan-U-PaLM 540B, they can simulate the execution of a universal Turing machine
 This means that the augmented model can potentially perform any algorithm on any input
 The key finding is that this universality can be achieved without modifying the weights of the language model, but by designing a stored instruction computer that connects the model to the memory


2.
The authors of this paper have created a stored instruction computer that can simulate a universal Turing machine
 They designed a specific program called a "prompt program" to drive the system and simulate the Turing machine
 The simulation is achieved by providing specific prompt strings to the language model and parsing its outputs to determine values to be saved in memory
 The interaction between the language model and memory is restricted to finite state computation using simple regular expression parsers
 The outputs from the language model are parsed using regular expressions to detect assignments and apply them to the associative memory
 The values in the memory can also be substituted using regular expressions
 The code provided is in Python and uses the regular expression library "re"


3.
The authors have implemented a stored instruction computer that can update variables in memory based on the output of the language model
 The output string is parsed to detect assignments and increment/decrement updates, and these updates are applied to the memory
 The input prompts to the language model are retrieved from a special memory location and can include splicing of values from memory
 The computer runs a compute cycle by retrieving the next prompt string, passing it to the language model, processing the output, and updating the memory
 This process continues until a special instruction is encountered
 The authors also mention the concept of a universal Turing machine, which is a computing machine that can simulate the execution of any other computing machine on any input


4.
The authors discuss the concept of a Turing machine, which is a theoretical computing machine that consists of a finite state controller and an unbounded tape memory
 They explain how the machine executes compute cycles by updating the tape memory based on transition rules
 They mention the efforts to identify the smallest universal Turing machines in terms of the number of states and tape symbols used
 They introduce a specific universal Turing machine called U15,2, which uses only 15 states and 2 tape symbols
 The authors then propose a prompt program that can be used to program the stored instruction computer to simulate the U15,2 Turing machine
 They will verify the execution of this program using a specific large language model called Flan-U-PaLM 540B


5.
The authors have designed a prompt program that instructs the language model on the behavior of variable assignments, variable evaluations, and if-then conditionals
 They provide a "boot" prompt that sets up the initial instructions and then define a series of "instruction" prompts that correspond to the states of the U15,2 Turing machine
 Each instruction prompt updates variables and includes conditional statements
 The program is designed to mimic the behavior of the U15,2 Turing machine


6.
The authors have provided a detailed explanation of how the prompt program works
 They explain that the program uses memory locations to keep track of the Turing machine head's current location
 The program includes post-processing and pre-processing steps to handle variable assignments and control branching
 The program uses placeholders like %[x] to represent values in memory, which are replaced with the actual values during post-processing
 The program also includes branching instructions that assign new instruction strings to the memory


7.
The authors explain how the prompt program is designed to mimic the behavior of the U15,2 Turing machine
 They discuss the use of placeholders and nested substitutions in the program to handle variable assignments and control branching
 They explain that each instruction string in the program corresponds to a state in the U15,2 Turing machine and correctly updates variables, writes symbols, and moves the head
 The authors claim that each compute cycle of the prompt program is equivalent to a compute cycle of the Turing machine
 They provide a proof by induction and explain how the program maintains the same behavior as the Turing machine


8.
The authors perform verification tests using the Flan-U-PaLM 540B language model to ensure that it produces the correct result strings for each instruction prompt
 They go through each possible combination of state and symbol and call the language model with the corresponding input prompt
 They then verify that the output matches the expected result string
 The authors provide the outputs of the verification tests for several cases to demonstrate the correctness of the language model


9.
The authors continue to perform verification tests using the Flan-U-PaLM 540B language model to ensure that it produces the correct result strings for each instruction prompt
 They provide the outputs of the verification tests for several cases to demonstrate the correctness of the language model
 The tests cover different combinations of states and symbols, and the outputs of the language model match the expected result strings

11.

 They provide the outputs of the verification tests to demonstrate that the language model accurately produces the desired results
 The authors conclude by mentioning that the study has provided evidence and proof of the language model's correctness


12.

 They mention the difficulty in interpreting conditionals and the limitations of the language model in handling if-then-else conditionals
 They compare their approach to simulating the U15,2 Turing machine with previous studies on the computational universality of neural sequence models
